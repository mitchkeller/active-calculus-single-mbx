<div class="para">The linearization <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> of <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(t=a\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(L(t) = s(a) + s'(a)(t-a)\text{.}\)</span> With the information we have we can find the linearization of <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(t=9\text{,}\)</span> using the facts that <span class="process-math">\(s(9) = 4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s'(9) = -1.2\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the linearization of <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(t=9\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(L(t) = 4 - 1.2(t-9)\text{.}\)</span> One use of the linearization is that for <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> close to <span class="process-math">\(9\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(L(t)\)</span> can provide a good approximation to <span class="process-math">\(s(t)\text{.}\)</span> So</div>

<li><div class="para">Given that <span class="process-math">\(s'(4)\)</span> is negative, the object is moving back toward its original position.
