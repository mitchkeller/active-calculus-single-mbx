<li><div class="para">The average velocity on <span class="process-math">\([0.5,1]\)</span> is the slope of the line joining the points <span class="process-math">\((0.5,s(0.5))\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((1,s(1))\text{,}\)</span> which is <span class="process-math">\(AV_{[0.5,1]} = \frac{1-1}{1-0.5} = 0\text{.}\)</span> On <span class="process-math">\([1.5,2.5]\text{,}\)</span> we similarly find <span class="process-math">\(AV_{[1.5,2.5]} = \frac{3-1}{2.5-1.5} = 2\text{,}\)</span> and on <span class="process-math">\([0,5]\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(AV_{[0,5]} = \frac{5-0}{5-0} = 1\text{.}\)</span>

<li><div class="para">Take shorter and shorter time intervals and draw the lines whose slopes represent average velocity. If those lines' slopes are approaching a single number, that number represents the instantaneous velocity. For example, to estimate the instantaneous velocity at <span class="process-math">\(t = 2\text{,}\)</span> we might consider average velocities on <span class="process-math">\([2,3]\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\([2,2.5]\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([2,2.25]\text{.}\)</span>

<li><div class="para">If we draw the line through <span class="process-math">\((2,2)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((2.1,s(2.1))\text{,}\)</span> it looks like the line's slope is approximately 2.5: if we go over one grid-width, we appear to go up about 2.5. The slope of this line is clearly greater than the slope of the line through <span class="process-math">\((1.5, s(1.5))\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((2.5, s(2.5))\text{,}\)</span> which is 2. Hence the instantaneous velocity at <span class="process-math">\(t = 2\)</span> is greater than the average velocity on <span class="process-math">\([1.5,2.5]\text{.}\)</span>
