<p>Derivatives can be used to help us evaluate indeterminate limits of the form <span class="process-math">\(\frac{0}{0}\)</span> through L'Hôpital's Rule, by replacing the functions in the numerator and denominator with their tangent line approximations. In particular, if <span class="process-math">\(f(a) = g(a) = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> are differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> L'Hôpital's Rule tells us that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to a}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x \to a}\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\text{.}

<li><p>When we write <span class="process-math">\(x \to \infty\text{,}\)</span> this means that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is increasing without bound. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x) = L\)</span> means that we can make <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as close to <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as we like by choosing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to be sufficiently large. Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = \infty\text{,}\)</span> means that we can make <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as large as we like by choosing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> sufficiently close to <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span></p></li>

<p>A version of L'Hôpital's Rule also helps us evaluate indeterminate limits of the form <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> are differentiable and both approach zero or both approach <span class="process-math">\(\pm \infty\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x \to a\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is allowed to be <span class="process-math">\(\infty\)</span>), then</p>
