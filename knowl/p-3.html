<div class="para">The current .html version of the text is possible only because of the amazing work of Rob Beezer and his development of the original Mathbook XML, now known as <a class="external" href="https://pretextbook.org/" target="_blank">PreTeXt</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-3-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.4"><sup> 4 </sup></a>. My ability to take advantage of Rob's work is due in large part to the support of the American Institute of Mathematics, which funded me to attend a weeklong workshop in Mathbook XML in San Jose, CA, in April 2016, as well as the support of the ongoing <a class="external" href="https://groups.google.com/g/pretext-support" target="_blank">user group</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-4-hidden.html" title="Footnote 0.0.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a>.  A subsequent workshop in June 2019 has offered further support and more improvements to the text.</div>
