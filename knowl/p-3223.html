<div class="para">The point <span class="process-math">\(A = (-\sqrt{3}, f(-\sqrt{3}))\)</span> is a local maximum, because <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is increasing prior to <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and decreasing after; similarly, the point <span class="process-math">\(E = (\sqrt{3}, f(\sqrt{3})\)</span> is a local minimum. Note, too, that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is concave down at <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and concave up at <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> which is consistent both with our second derivative sign chart and the second derivative test. At points <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> concavity changes, as we saw in the results of the second derivative sign chart in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-3-1-signchart3.html" title="Figure 3.1.12">FigureÂ 3.1.12</a>. Finally, at point <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a critical point with a horizontal tangent line, but neither a maximum nor a minimum occurs there, since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is decreasing both before and after <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> It is also the case that concavity changes at <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span>
