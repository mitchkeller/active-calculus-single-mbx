<div class="para">It is helpful to think of the depth below the surface of the crock as being the independent variable, so we let the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis point down, and the positive <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis to the right, as pictured in the figure. Because the pump sits on the surface of the water, it makes sense to think about the pump moving the water one “slice” at a time, where it takes a thin slice from the surface, pumps it out of the tank, and then proceeds to pump the next slice below.</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Each slice of water is cylindrical in shape. We see that the radius of each slice varies according to the linear function <span class="process-math">\(y = f(x)\)</span> that passes through the points <span class="process-math">\((0,1.5)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((4,0.75)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is the depth of the particular slice in the tank; it is a straightforward exercise to find that <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = 1.5 - 0.1875x\text{.}\)</span> Now we think about the problem in several steps:</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">determining the volume of a typical slice;</div></li>
<li><div class="para">finding the weight<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-106-hidden.html" title="Footnote 6.4.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a> of a typical slice (and thus the force that must be exerted on it);</div></li>
<li><div class="para">deciding the distance that a typical slice moves;</div></li>
<li><div class="para">and computing the work to move a representative slice.</div></li>
</ol>
<div class="para">Once we know the work it takes to move one slice, we use a definite integral over an appropriate interval to find the total work.</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Consider a representative cylindrical slice at a depth of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> feet below the top of the crock. The approximate volume of that slice is given by</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}

<div class="para">Since water weighs 62.4 lb/ft<span class="process-math">\(^3\text{,}\)</span> the approximate weight of a representative slice is</div>

\begin{equation*}

</div>
<div class="para">This is also the approximate force the pump must exert to move the slice.</div>
</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Because the slice is located at a depth of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> feet below the top of the crock, the slice being moved by the pump must move <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> feet to get to the level of the basement floor, and then, as stated in the problem description, another 9 feet to reach the drain at ground level. Hence, the total distance a representative slice travels is</div>

\begin{equation*}
d_{\text{slice} } = x + 9\text{.}

<div class="para">Finally, the work to move a representative slice is given by</div>

\begin{equation*}
W_{\text{slice} } = F_{\text{slice} } \cdot d_{\text{slice} } = 62.4 \pi (1.5 - 0.1875x)^2 \Delta x \cdot (x+9)\text{.}

</div> <div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We sum the work required to move slices throughout the tank (from <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x = 4\)</span>), let <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x \to 0\text{,}\)</span> and hence</div>

\begin{equation*}
W = \int_0^4 62.4 \pi (1.5 - 0.1875x)^2 (x+9) \, dx\text{.}
