<p>Now we consider larger loans, e.g., automobile loans or mortgages, in which we borrow a specified amount of money over a specified period of time. In this situation, we need to determine the amount of the monthly payment we need to make to pay off the loan in the specified amount of time. In this situation, we need to find the monthly payment <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> that will take our outstanding principal to <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> in the specified amount of time. To do so, we want to know the value of <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> that makes <span class="process-math">\(P(t) = 0\)</span> in formulaÂ <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-loan2.html" title="Equation 8.2.9">(8.2.9)</a>. If we set <span class="process-math">\(P(t) = 0\)</span> and solve for <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> it follows that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eq-loan2.html">
\begin{equation*}
M = \frac{rP \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - 1 \right)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}

<li><p>Suppose we want to borrow $15,000 to buy a car. We take out a 5 year loan at 6.25%. What will our monthly payments be? How much in total will we have paid for this $15,000 car? How much total interest will we pay on this loan?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you charge your books for winter semester on your credit card. The total charge comes to $525. If your credit card has an interest rate of 18% and you pay $20 per month on the card, how long will it take before you pay off this debt? How much total interest will you pay?</p></li>

<p>Say you need to borrow $100,000 to buy a house. You have several options on the loan:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>30 years at 6.5%</p></li>
<li><p>25 years at 7.5%</p></li>
<li><p>15 years at 8.25%.</p></li>

<li><p>What are the monthly payments for each loan?</p></li>
<li><p>Which mortgage is ultimately the best deal (assuming you can afford the monthly payments)? In other words, for which loan do you pay the least amount of total interest?</p></li>
