</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Using the strategy of finding a higher degree polynomial whose function and derivative values match at the selected point of tangency, we are able to find higher degree polynomials that much more effectively approximate <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = e^x\)</span> near <span class="process-math">\(a = 0\)</span> than the approximation generated by the tangent line.  For example, using the degree <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> approximation <span class="process-math">\(T_3(x) = 1 + x + \frac{1}{2}x^2 + \frac{1}{6}x^3\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(|f(x) - T_3(x)| \lt 0.01\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that satisfy <span class="process-math">\(|x| \lt 0.6\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">It appears that the degree of the polynomial impacts the accuracy of the approximation of <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = e^x\)</span> in at least two ways:  if we fix an <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-value, the higher the degree of the polynomial, the more accurate the approximation.  In addition, raising the degree of the polynomial approximation appears to widen the interval on which the approximation is effective.</div></li>
