<em class="alert">1.</em> The answer is C, because the amount of the drug in the patient’s body decays exponentially. <em class="alert">2.</em> The answer is E, because the petri dish can only sustain the population up to a certain size. The population will grow until it reaches this limiting value. <em class="alert">3.</em> The answer is D, because the speed of the car is constant, and then decreases linearly when the breaks are applied uniformly. <em class="alert">4.</em> The answer is A, because the cost of the product, in the absence of any change in inflation, increases exponentially. <em class="alert">5.</em> The answer is B, because the parachuter’s speed will increase, then decrease after the parachute is deployed.</div></body>
