<p>We recalling that a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a limit <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> at infinity if we can make the values of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as large as we want by choosing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as large as we need. Since we can make the values of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> in our sequence as large as we want by choosing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> to be as large as we need, we suspect that this sequence does not have a limit as <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> goes to infinity.</p>

<p>Since we can make the values of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span> in our sequence as close to 0 as we want by choosing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> to be as large as we need, we suspect that this sequence has a limit of 0 as <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> goes to infinity.</p>

<p>Since the numerator is always 1 more than the denominator, a formula for <span class="process-math">\(s_n\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(s_n = \frac{n+1}{n}\text{.}\)</span> A plot of the first 50 points in the sequence is shown here.</p>
