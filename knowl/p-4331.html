<li><p>If we know the velocity of a moving body at every point in a given interval and the velocity is positive throughout, we can estimate the object's distance traveled and in some circumstances determine this value exactly.</p></li>
<li><p>In particular, when velocity is positive on an interval, we can find the total distance traveled by finding the area under the velocity curve and above the <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis on the given time interval. We may only be able to estimate this area, depending on the shape of the velocity curve.</p></li>
<li><p>An antiderivative of a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a new function <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> whose derivative is <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> That is, <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> provided that <span class="process-math">\(F' = f\text{.}\)</span> In the context of velocity and position, if we know a velocity function <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is a position function <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> that satisfies <span class="process-math">\(s' = v\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is positive on a given interval, say <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{,}\)</span> then the change in position, <span class="process-math">\(s(b) - s(a)\text{,}\)</span> measures the distance the moving object traveled on <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If its velocity is sometimes negative, a moving object is sometimes traveling in the opposite direction or backtracking. To determine distance traveled, we have to compute the distance separately on intervals where velocity is positive or negative, and account for the change in position on each such interval.</p></li>
