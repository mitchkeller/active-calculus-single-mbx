<div class="para">But the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-1-7-NotDiff.html" title="Figure 1.7.8">Figure 1.7.8</a> is not differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(a = 1\)</span> because <span class="process-math">\(f'(1)\)</span> fails to exist. One way to see this is to observe that <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) = -1\)</span> for every value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that is less than 1, while <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) = +1\)</span> for every value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that is greater than 1. That makes it seem that either <span class="process-math">\(+1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> would be equally good candidates for the value of the derivative at <span class="process-math">\(x = 1\text{.}\)</span> Alternately, we could use the limit definition of the derivative to attempt to compute <span class="process-math">\(f'(1)\text{,}\)</span> and discover that the derivative does not exist. Finally, we can see visually that the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-1-7-NotDiff.html" title="Figure 1.7.8">Figure 1.7.8</a> does not have a tangent line. When we zoom in on <span class="process-math">\((1,1)\)</span> on the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> no matter how closely we examine the function, it will always look like a “V”, and never like a single line, which tells us there is no possibility for a tangent line there.</div>
