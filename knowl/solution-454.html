<div class="image-box" style="width: 41.6666666666667%; margin-left: 29.1666666666667%; margin-right: 29.1666666666667%;"><img src="generated/webwork/images/webwork-207-image-2.png" class="contained"></div> Thus we get different solution behaviors for the initial conditions <span class="process-math">\(P(0) = 0.5\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P(0) &gt; 0.5\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt  P(0) \lt  0.5\text{.}\)</span>  The initial condition <span class="process-math">\(P(0) = 0\)</span> gives the zero solution, which is an equilibrium and has the same behavior as the initial condition <span class="process-math">\(P(0) = 0.5\text{.}\)</span>  Note that we can also say that the behavior for initial conditions <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt  P(0) \lt  0.25\)</span> is different from that for initial conditions <span class="process-math">\(0.25 \le P(0) \lt  0.5\text{,}\)</span> because the former will be sigmoidal while the latter are strictly exponential. From the solutions graphed above, or by looking at the slope field, we can see that the equilibrium solution <span class="process-math">\(P = 0.5\)</span> is stable.  The other equilibrium solution, <span class="process-math">\(P = 0\)</span> is unstable. Also by looking at the solution curves, we can see that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is increasing when <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt  P \lt  0.5\)</span> and decreasing when <span class="process-math">\(P &gt; 0.5\text{.}\)</span> In the long run, we're most likely to start with a non-zero population and thus <span class="process-math">\(P\to 0.5\text{.}\)</span>  The solution curves with initial populations of less than <span class="process-math">\(P= 0.25\)</span> have inflection points at <span class="process-math">\(P=0.25\text{.}\)</span> (This will be demonstrated algebraically below.)  At the inflection point, the population is growing fastest. A graph of <span class="process-math">\(dP/dt\)</span> against <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is shown below. <div class="image-box" style="width: 41.6666666666667%; margin-left: 29.1666666666667%; margin-right: 29.1666666666667%;"><img src="generated/webwork/images/webwork-207-image-3.png" class="contained"></div> Since <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dP}{dt}=2.5 P - 5 P^2 = 5 P(0.5 - P)\text{,}\)</span> the graph of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dP}{dt}\)</span> against <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is a parabola, opening downward with <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> intercepts at 0 and 0.5. The quantity <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dP}{dt}\)</span> is positive for <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt  P \lt  0.5\text{,}\)</span> negative for <span class="process-math">\(P &gt; 0.5\)</span> (and <span class="process-math">\(P \lt  0\)</span>).  The quantity <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dP}{dt}\)</span> is 0 at <span class="process-math">\(P=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P=\text{,}\)</span> and maximum at <span class="process-math">\(P=0.25\text{.}\)</span> The fact that <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dP}{dt} =0\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(P=0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P=0.5\)</span> tells us that these are equilibria.  Further, since <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dP}{dt}&gt; 0\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt  P
\lt  0.5\text{,}\)</span> we see that solution curves starting here will increase toward <span class="process-math">\(P=0.5\text{.}\)</span> If the population starts at a value <span class="process-math">\(P\lt 0.25\text{,}\)</span> it increases at an increasing rate up to <span class="process-math">\(P=0.25\text{.}\)</span>  After this, <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> continues to increase, but at a decreasing rate.  The fact that <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dP}{dt}\)</span> has a maximum at <span class="process-math">\(P=0.25\)</span> tells us that there is a point of inflection when <span class="process-math">\(P=0.25\text{.}\)</span>  Similarly, since <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dP}{dt} \lt  0\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(P &gt; 0.5\text{,}\)</span> solution curves starting with <span class="process-math">\(P &gt; 1\)</span> will decrease to <span class="process-math">\(P =
0.5\text{.}\)</span>  Thus, <span class="process-math">\(P=0.5\)</span> is a stable equilibrium.</div>
