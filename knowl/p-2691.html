<div class="para">In light of the earlier example involving shares of stock, the product rule also makes sense intuitively: the rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> should take into account both how fast <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> are changing, as well as how large <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> are at the point of interest. In words the product rule says: if <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is the product of two functions <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> (the first function) and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> (the second), then “the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is the first times the derivative of the second, plus the second times the derivative of the first.” It is often a helpful mental exercise to say this phrasing aloud when executing the product rule.</div>
