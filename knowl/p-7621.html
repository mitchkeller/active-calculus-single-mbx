<div class="para">A computer algebra system (CAS) is a computer program that is capable of executing symbolic mathematics. For example, if we ask a CAS to solve the equation <span class="process-math">\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\)</span> for the variable <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c\)</span> are arbitrary constants, the program will return <span class="process-math">\(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\text{.}\)</span> Research to develop the first CAS dates to the 1960s, and these programs became publicly available in the early 1990s. Two prominent examples are the programs <em class="emphasis">Maple</em> and <em class="emphasis">Mathematica</em>, which were among the first computer algebra systems to offer a graphical user interface. Today, <em class="emphasis">Maple</em> and <em class="emphasis">Mathematica</em> are exceptionally powerful professional software packages that can execute an amazing array of sophisticated mathematical computations. They are also very expensive, as each is a proprietary program. The CAS <em class="emphasis">SAGE</em> is an open-source, free alternative to <em class="emphasis">Maple</em> and <em class="emphasis">Mathematica</em>.</div>
