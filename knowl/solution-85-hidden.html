<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">
<em class="alert">(a)</em> As the cup of coffee cools, the temperature decreases, so <span class="process-math">\(f'(t)\)</span> is negative. <em class="alert">(b)</em> Since <span class="process-math">\(f'(t) = dH/dt\text{,}\)</span> the units are degrees Celsius per minute (degC/min).  The quantity <span class="process-math">\(f'(30)\)</span> represents the rate at which the coffee is cooling, in degrees per minute, 30 minutes after the cup is put on the counter.  Thus we can complete the statement: At 30 minutes after the coffee was put on the counter, its temperature is 51 degC and will decrease by about 1.125 degC in the next 75 seconds.</div></body>
