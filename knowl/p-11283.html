<div class="para">A function such as <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \sin(x)\)</span> that is infinitely differentiable and has a convergent power series that converges on some interval to the function itself is said to be <dfn class="terminology">analytic</dfn>.  Analytic functions are amazing and among the nicest functions in all of mathematics:  they are completely determined by what happens at a single point.  Almost all functions are not analytic.  For example, if a function  measures your location as a function of time on a highway, that function cannot be analytic, since what happens at 12:01 is independent of what happens at 12:00 due to other circumstances such as traffic or construction.  At the same time, the mathematical universe is better to us than we deserve in that many of the most interesting functions are analytic, including those weâ€™ve mentioned (<span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1-x}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ln(1+x)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\sin(x)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\cos(x)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span>) and most of those represented by buttons on a calculator.</div>
