<li><div class="para">If we multiply <span class="process-math">\(A(t)\)</span> acres by <span class="process-math">\(Y(t)\)</span> bushels per acre, we arrive at <span class="process-math">\(C(t) = A(t)Y(t)\)</span> bushels as the total number of bushels of corn the farmer produces in year <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We are given that <span class="process-math">\(A(0) = 7000\)</span> acres with a yield of <span class="process-math">\(Y(0) = 170\)</span> bushels per acre, giving us <span class="process-math">\(C(0) = A(0)Y(0) = (7000)(170) = 1190000\)</span> bushels. Thus, the farmer produces <span class="process-math">\(1 190 000\)</span> bushels of corn in the present year.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The product rule tells us that <span class="process-math">\(C'(t) = A(t)Y'(t) + A'(t)Y(t)\text{.}\)</span>

<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">We know <span class="process-math">\(A(0) = 7000\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Y(0) = 170\text{.}\)</span> We are also given that the farmer will increase his number of acres devoted to growing corn at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(600\)</span> acres/year, and he expects that right now his average yield is increasing at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> bushels per acre per year. This tells us that <span class="process-math">\(A'(t) = 600\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Y'(0) = 8\text{.}\)</span> So</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
C'(0) = A(0)Y'(0) + A'(0)Y(0) = (7000)(8) + (600)(170) = 158 000\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Note that the units of <span class="process-math">\(A(t)\)</span> are acres and the units of <span class="process-math">\(Y'(t)\)</span> are bushels per acre per year. So the units of <span class="process-math">\(A(0)Y'(0)\)</span> are bushels per year. Similarly, the units of <span class="process-math">\(A'(t)\)</span> are acres per year and the units of <span class="process-math">\(Y(t)\)</span> are bushels per acre, so the units of <span class="process-math">\(A'(0)Y(0)\)</span> are also bushels per acre. So the units of <span class="process-math">\(C'(0)\)</span> are bushels per acre. Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(C'(0) = 158 000\)</span> tells us that the number of bushels the farmer can produce will increase by approximately <span class="process-math">\(158 000\)</span> bushels for each year past the present year.</div>
