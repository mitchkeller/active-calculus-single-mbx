<p>Because <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is measured in feet per second and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in seconds, the units on <span class="process-math">\(v'(1)\)</span> are ``feet per second per second.'' Knowing that <span class="process-math">\(v'(1) = -32\text{,}\)</span> this tells us that the ball's velocity is decreasing at a rate of 32 feet per second per second; that is, for whatever the ball's velocity is at <span class="process-math">\(t = 1\text{,}\)</span> we would expect the velocity to decrease by (exactly) <span class="process-math">\(32\)</span> feet per second over the next one second. (Normally this total decrease would be approximate, not exact, but since the velocity function is linear, we can compute the exact total change.)</p>
