<div class="para">Now suppose that the coneâ€™s density is not uniform, but rather that the cone is most dense at its base. In particular, assume that the density of the cone is uniform across cross sections parallel to its base, but that in each such cross section that is a distance <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> units from the origin, the density of the cross section is given by the function <span class="process-math">\(\rho(x) = 400 + \frac{200}{1+x^2}\text{,}\)</span> measured in kg/m<span class="process-math">\(^3\text{.}\)</span> Determine and evaluate a definite integral whose value is the mass of this cone of non-uniform density. Do so by first thinking about the mass of a given slice of the cone <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> units away from the base; remember that in such a slice, the density will be <em class="emphasis">essentially constant</em>.</div>
