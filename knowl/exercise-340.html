<p>Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(b(t)\)</span> measures the number of bacteria living in a colony in a Petri dish, where <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is measured in thousands and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is measured in days. One day, you measure that there are 6,000 bacteria and the per capita growth rate is 3. A few days later, you measure that there are 9,000 bacteria and the per capita growth rate is 2.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Assume that the per capita growth rate <span class="process-math">\(\frac{db/dt}{b}\)</span> is a linear function of <span class="process-math">\(b\text{.}\)</span> Use the measurements to find this function and write a logistic equation to describe <span class="process-math">\(\frac{db}{dt}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>What is the carrying capacity for the bacteria?</p></li>
<li><p>At what population is the number of bacteria increasing most rapidly?</p></li>
<li><p>If there are initially 1,000 bacteria, how long will it take to reach 80% of the carrying capacity?</p></li>
