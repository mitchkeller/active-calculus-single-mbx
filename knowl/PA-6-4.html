<p>A bucket is being lifted from the bottom of a 50-foot deep well; its weight (including the water), <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> in pounds at a height <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> feet above the water is given by the function <span class="process-math">\(B(h)\text{.}\)</span> When the bucket leaves the water, the bucket and water together weigh <span class="process-math">\(B(0) = 20\)</span> pounds, and when the bucket reaches the top of the well, <span class="process-math">\(B(50) = 12\)</span> pounds. Assume that the bucket loses water at a constant rate (as a function of height, <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span>) throughout its journey from the bottom to the top of the well.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Find a formula for <span class="process-math">\(B(h)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Compute the value of the product <span class="process-math">\(B(5) \Delta h\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(\Delta h = 2\)</span> feet. Include units on your answer. Explain why this product represents the approximate work it took to move the bucket of water from <span class="process-math">\(h = 5\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(h = 7\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Is the value in (b) an over- or under-estimate of the actual amount of work it took to move the bucket from <span class="process-math">\(h = 5\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(h = 7\text{?}\)</span> Why?</p></li>

<li><p>More generally, what does the quantity <span class="process-math">\(W_{\text{slice} } = B(h) \Delta h\)</span> measure for a given value of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> and a small positive value of <span class="process-math">\(\Delta h\text{?}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the definite integral <span class="process-math">\(\int_0^{50} B(h) \, dh\text{.}\)</span> What is the meaning of the value you find? Why?</p></li>
