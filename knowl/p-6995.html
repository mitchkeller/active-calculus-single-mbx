<div class="para">In the situation where we have <span class="process-math">\((x-a)\)</span> under a square root and a polynomial outside the square root, the substitution <span class="process-math">\(u = x-a\)</span> will allow us to convert the integrand into an expression we can integrate by changing the form of the radical from <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{x-a}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{u}\text{.}\)</span> From there we are able to distribute and integrate an expression that is essentially a sum of (fractional) powers of <span class="process-math">\(u\text{.}\)</span> In the situation where a polynomial of degree higher than <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> (such as <span class="process-math">\(x^2 - 1\)</span>) is under the radical, we likely have to be fortunate enough to have the derivative of said polynomial (up to a constant) outside the radical in order to be able to integrate, as we were in the last example.</div>
