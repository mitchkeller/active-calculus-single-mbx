<p>A student with a third floor dormitory window 32 feet off the ground tosses a water balloon straight up in the air with an initial velocity of 16 feet per second. It turns out that the instantaneous velocity of the water balloon is given by <span class="process-math">\(v(t) = -32t + 16\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is measured in feet per second and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is measured in seconds.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Let <span class="process-math">\(s(t)\)</span> represent the height of the water balloon above ground at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> and note that <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> That is, <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(s\text{:}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(s'(t) = v(t)\text{.}\)</span> Find a formula for <span class="process-math">\(s(t)\)</span> that satisfies the initial condition that the balloon is tossed from 32 feet above ground. In other words, make your formula for <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> satisfy <span class="process-math">\(s(0) = 32\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>When does the water balloon reach its maximum height? When does it land?</p></li>
<li><p>Compute <span class="process-math">\(s(\frac{1}{2}) - s(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(s(2) - s(\frac{1}{2})\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s(2) - s(0)\text{.}\)</span> What do these represent?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the total vertical distance traveled by the water balloon from the time it is tossed until the time it lands?</p></li>
<li><p>Sketch a graph of the velocity function <span class="process-math">\(y = v(t)\)</span> on the time interval <span class="process-math">\([0,2]\text{.}\)</span> What is the total net signed area bounded by <span class="process-math">\(y = v(t)\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis on <span class="process-math">\([0,2]\text{?}\)</span> Answer this question in two ways: first by using your work above, and then by using a familiar geometric formula to compute areas of certain relevant regions.</p></li>
