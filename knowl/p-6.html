<p>Over my more than 20 years at GVSU, many of my colleagues have shared with me ideas and resources for teaching calculus. I am particularly indebted to David Austin, Will Dickinson, Paul Fishback, Jon Hodge, and Steve Schlicker for their contributions that improved my teaching of and thinking about calculus, including materials that I have modified and used over many different semesters with students. Parts of these ideas can be found throughout this text. In addition, Will Dickinson and Steve Schlicker provided me access to a large number of their electronic notes and activities from teaching of differential and integral calculus, and those ideas and materials have similarly impacted my work and writing in positive ways, with some of their problems and approaches finding parallel presentation here.</p>
