<div class="para">The linearization of <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> does not provide a good approximation to <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> since 1 is not very close to 0. To obtain a better approximation, we alter our approach a bit. Instead of using a straight line to approximate <span class="process-math">\(e\text{,}\)</span> we put an appropriate bend in our estimating function to make it better fit the graph of <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> close to 0. With the linearization, we had both <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> share the same value as the linearization at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> We will now use a quadratic approximation <span class="process-math">\(P_2(x)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = e^x\)</span> centered at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> which has the property that <span class="process-math">\(P_2(0) = f(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P'_2(0) = f'(0)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\text{.}\)</span>
