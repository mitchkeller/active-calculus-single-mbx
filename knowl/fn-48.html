</h4>While this example highlights why the product rule is true, there are some subtle issues to recognize. For one, if the stock’s value really does rise exactly $0.75 on day 100, and the number of shares really rises by 12 on day 100, then we’d expect that <span class="process-math">\(V(101) = N(101) \cdot S(101) = 532 \cdot 28.25 = 15029\text{.}\)</span> If, as noted above, we expect the total value to rise by $720, then with <span class="process-math">\(V(100) = N(100) \cdot S(100) = 520 \cdot 27.50 = 14300\text{,}\)</span> then it seems we should find that <span class="process-math">\(V(101) = V(100) + 720 = 15020\text{.}\)</span> Why do the two results differ by 9? One way to understand why this difference occurs is to recognize that <span class="process-math">\(N'(100) = 12\)</span> represents an <em class="emphasis">instantaneous</em> rate of change, while our (informal) discussion has also thought of this number as the total change in the number of shares over the course of a single day. The formal proof of the product rule reconciles this issue by taking the limit as the change in the input tends to zero.</div>
