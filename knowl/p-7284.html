<div class="para">A typical slice is a thin cylinder of radius 2 and thickness <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\text{.}\)</span> The volume of such a cylinder is <span class="process-math">\(V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (2)^2 \Delta x\text{,}\)</span> and its weight is thus <span class="process-math">\(F_{\text{slice}} = 1000 \cdot 9.81 \cdot V_{\text{slice}} = 4000 \cdot 9.81 \pi \Delta x\text{.}\)</span> Finally, the distance such a slice travels to the top of the tank is <span class="process-math">\(d_{\text{slice}} = x\text{.}\)</span> If we only pump out the top 1 m of water, which corresponds to the water between <span class="process-math">\(x=2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=3\)</span> because the tank is full to a depth of 4 m, it follows that the total work is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">

<div class="para">Viewing the tank as a solid of revolution, the tank is generated by the function <span class="process-math">\(R(x) = \sqrt{100-x^2}\text{,}\)</span> and a typical slice has volume <span class="process-math">\(V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (\sqrt{100-x^2})^2 \Delta x\text{.}\)</span> The force to move such a slice is its weight, <span class="process-math">\(F_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 \cdot V_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 \pi (100-x^2) \Delta x\text{.}\)</span> Each slice has to move <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> feet to clear the top of the tank, and then an additional 5 feet up to the truck, so the distance each slice moves is <span class="process-math">\(d_{\text{slice}} = x + 5\text{.}\)</span> Finally, since the tank is full to a depth of 7 feet, and we wish to pump out the top 5 feet, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> ranges from <span class="process-math">\(x=3\)</span> (the top of the water) to <span class="process-math">\(x=8\)</span> (the point at which there are 2 feet remaining in the tank). Hence, the total work done is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}

<div class="para">The line that bounds the right edge of the triangular face of the tank lying in the first quadrant is <span class="process-math">\(y=\frac{5}{2} - \frac{5}{8}x\text{.}\)</span> If we take a slice of water that lies at depth <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> note that the slice is rectangular with thickness <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\text{,}\)</span> length 10 (the tank is 10 feet long), and width <span class="process-math">\(2(\frac{5}{2} - \frac{5}{8}x)\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the volume of a typical slice is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
V_{\text{slice}} = 10 \cdot 2(\frac{5}{2} - \frac{5}{8}x) \cdot \Delta x = (50 - \frac{25}{2}x) \Delta x\text{,}

<div class="para">The distance a typical slice moves when pumped to the top of the tank is <span class="process-math">\(d_{\text{slice}} = x\text{,}\)</span> and since the tank is full to a depth of 3 feet (within 1 foot of the top) and we are going to empty the tank until 1 foot of water remains in it, we see that we need to integrate from <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x=3\text{,}\)</span> so</div>
