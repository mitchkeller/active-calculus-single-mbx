<div class="para">Finally, we make two important notes about Simpson's Rule. When T. Simpson first developed this rule, his idea was to replace the function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> on a given interval with a quadratic function that shared three values with the function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> In so doing, he guaranteed that this new approximation rule would be exact for the definite integral of any quadratic polynomial. In one of the pleasant surprises of numerical analysis, it turns out that even though it was designed to be exact for quadratic polynomials, Simpson's Rule is exact for any cubic polynomial: that is, if we are interested in an integral such as <span class="process-math">\(\int_2^5 (5x^3 - 2x^2 + 7x - 4)\, dx\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(S_{2n}\)</span> will always be exact, regardless of the value of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> This is just one more piece of evidence that shows how effective Simpson's Rule is as an approximation tool for estimating definite integrals.<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-100-hidden.html" title="Footnote 5.6.5"><sup> 5 </sup></a>
