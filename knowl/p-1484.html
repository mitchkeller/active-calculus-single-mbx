<div class="para">Exploring the context of position, velocity, and acceleration is an excellent way to understand how a function, its first derivative, and its second derivative are related to one another. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act-1-6-1.html" title="Activity 1.6.2">ActivityÂ 1.6.2</a>, we can replace <span class="process-math">\(s\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(v\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> with an arbitrary function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and its derivatives <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f''\text{,}\)</span> and essentially all the same observations hold. In particular, note that the following are equivalent: on an interval where the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is concave up, <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is increasing and <span class="process-math">\(f''\)</span> is positive. Likewise, on an interval where the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is concave down, <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is decreasing and <span class="process-math">\(f''\)</span> is negative.</div>
