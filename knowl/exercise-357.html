<div class="para">The goal of a federal government stimulus package is to positively affect the economy. Economists and politicians quote numbers like “<span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> million jobs and a net stimulus to the economy of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> billion of dollars.” Where do they get these numbers? Let's consider one aspect of a stimulus package: tax cuts. Economists understand that tax cuts or rebates can result in long-term spending that is many times the amount of the rebate. For example, assume that for a typical person, 75% of her entire income is spent (that is, put back into the economy). Further, assume the government provides a tax cut or rebate that totals <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> dollars for each person.</div> <div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">The tax cut of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> dollars is income for its recipient. How much of this tax cut will be spent?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">In this simple model, we will say that the spent portion of the tax cut/rebate from part (a) then becomes income for another person who, in turn, spends 75% of this income. After this ``second round" of spent income, how many total dollars have been added to the economy as a result of the original tax cut/rebate?</div></li>

<div class="para">This second round of spending becomes income for another group who spend 75% of this income, and so on. In economics this is called the <em class="emphasis">multiplier effect</em>.
