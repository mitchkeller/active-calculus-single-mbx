<li><p>Find the tangent line to <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and use this linearization to approximate <span class="process-math">\(\ln(2)\text{.}\)</span> That is, find <span class="process-math">\(L(x)\text{,}\)</span> the tangent line approximation to <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> and use the fact that <span class="process-math">\(L(1) \approx f(1)\)</span> to estimate <span class="process-math">\(\ln(2)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>The linearization of <span class="process-math">\(\ln(1+x)\)</span> does not provide a very good approximation to <span class="process-math">\(\ln(2)\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> is not that close to <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> To obtain a better approximation, we alter our approach; instead of using a straight line to approximate <span class="process-math">\(\ln(2)\text{,}\)</span> we use a quadratic function to account for the concavity of <span class="process-math">\(\ln(1+x)\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> close to <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> With the linearization, both the function's value and slope agree with the linearization's value and slope at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> We will now make a quadratic approximation <span class="process-math">\(P_2(x)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \ln(1+x)\)</span> centered at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> with the property that <span class="process-math">\(P_2(0) = f(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P'_2(0) = f'(0)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Let <span class="process-math">\(P_2(x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2}\text{.}\)</span> Show that <span class="process-math">\(P_2(0) = f(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P'_2(0) = f'(0)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\text{.}\)</span> Use <span class="process-math">\(P_2(x)\)</span> to approximate <span class="process-math">\(\ln(2)\)</span> by using the fact that <span class="process-math">\(P_2(1) \approx f(1)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We can continue approximating <span class="process-math">\(\ln(2)\)</span> with polynomials of larger degree whose derivatives agree with those of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> This makes the polynomials fit the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> better for more values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> around <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> For example, let <span class="process-math">\(P_3(x) = x - \frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3}\text{.}\)</span> Show that <span class="process-math">\(P_3(0) = f(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P'_3(0) = f'(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P''_3(0) = f''(0)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P'''_3(0) = f'''(0)\text{.}\)</span> Taking a similar approach to preceding questions, use <span class="process-math">\(P_3(x)\)</span> to approximate <span class="process-math">\(\ln(2)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>If we used a degree <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> or degree <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> polynomial to approximate <span class="process-math">\(\ln(1+x)\text{,}\)</span> what approximations of <span class="process-math">\(\ln(2)\)</span> do you think would result? Use the preceding questions to conjecture a pattern that holds, and state the degree <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> and degree <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> approximation.</p></li>
