<div class="para">For example, suppose that the function <span class="process-math">\(y = P(t)\)</span> measures the population of a city (in thousands) at the start of year <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(t = 0\)</span> corresponds to 2010 AD). We are told that <span class="process-math">\(P'(2) = 21.37\text{.}\)</span> What is the meaning of this value? Well, since <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is measured in thousands and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is measured in years, we can say that the instantaneous rate of change of the city's population with respect to time at the start of 2012 is 21.37 thousand people per year. We therefore expect that in the coming year, about 21,370 people will be added to the city's population.</div>
