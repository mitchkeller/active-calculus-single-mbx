<div class="para">Consider the following situations in which mass is distributed in a non-constant manner.</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Suppose that a thin rod with constant cross-sectional area of 1 cm<span class="process-math">\(^2\)</span> has its mass distributed according to the density function <span class="process-math">\(\rho(x) = 2e^{-0.2x}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is the distance in cm from the left end of the rod, and the units on <span class="process-math">\(\rho(x)\)</span> are g/cm. If the rod is 10 cm long, determine the exact mass of the rod.</div></li>

<div class="para">Consider the cone that has a base of radius 4 m and a height of 5 m. Picture the cone lying horizontally with the center of its base at the origin and think of the cone as a solid of revolution.</div>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><div class="para">Write and evaluate a definite integral whose value is the volume of the cone.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Next, suppose that the cone has uniform density of 800 kg/m<span class="process-math">\(^3\text{.}\)</span> What is the mass of the solid cone?</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Now suppose that the cone's density is not uniform, but rather that the cone is most dense at its base. In particular, assume that the density of the cone is uniform across cross sections parallel to its base, but that in each such cross section that is a distance <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> units from the origin, the density of the cross section is given by the function <span class="process-math">\(\rho(x) = 400 + \frac{200}{1+x^2}\text{,}\)</span> measured in kg/m<span class="process-math">\(^3\text{.}\)</span> Determine and evaluate a definite integral whose value is the mass of this cone of non-uniform density. Do so by first thinking about the mass of a given slice of the cone <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> units away from the base; remember that in such a slice, the density will be <em class="emphasis">essentially constant</em>.</div></li>
