<div class="para">Viewing the tank as a solid of revolution, the tank is generated by the function <span class="process-math">\(R(x) = \sqrt{100-x^2}\text{,}\)</span> and a typical slice has volume <span class="process-math">\(V_{\text{slice}} = \pi (\sqrt{100-x^2})^2 \Delta x\text{.}\)</span> The force to move such a slice is its weight, <span class="process-math">\(F_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 \cdot V_{\text{slice}} = 62.4 \pi (100-x^2) \Delta x\text{.}\)</span> Each slice has to move <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> feet to clear the top of the tank, and then an additional 5 feet up to the truck, so the distance each slice moves is <span class="process-math">\(d_{\text{slice}} = x + 5\text{.}\)</span> Finally, since the tank is full to a depth of 7 feet, and we wish to pump out the top 5 feet, <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> ranges from <span class="process-math">\(x=3\)</span> (the top of the water) to <span class="process-math">\(x=8\)</span> (the point at which there are 2 feet remaining in the tank).
