<p>In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-3-1-2Dtest.html" title="Figure 3.1.9">FigureÂ 3.1.9</a>, we see the four possibilities for a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> that has a critical number <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> at which <span class="process-math">\(f'(p) = 0\text{,}\)</span> provided <span class="process-math">\(f''(p)\)</span> is not zero on an interval including <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> (except possibly at <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span>). On either side of the critical number, <span class="process-math">\(f''\)</span> can be either positive or negative, and hence <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> can be either concave up or concave down. In the first two graphs, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> does not change concavity at <span class="process-math">\(p\text{,}\)</span> and in those situations, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has either a local minimum or local maximum. In particular, if <span class="process-math">\(f'(p) = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f''(p) \lt 0\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is concave down at <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> with a horizontal tangent line, so <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a local maximum there. This fact, along with the corresponding statement for when <span class="process-math">\(f''(p)\)</span> is positive, is the substance of the <em class="emphasis">second derivative test</em>.</p>
