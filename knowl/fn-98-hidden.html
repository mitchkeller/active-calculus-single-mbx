<body class="ignore-math"><div class="fn">Thomas Simpson was an 18th century mathematician; his idea was to extend the Trapezoid rule, but rather than using straight lines to build trapezoids, to use quadratic functions to build regions whose area was bounded by parabolas (whose areas he could find exactly). Simpson's Rule is often developed from the more sophisticated perspective of using interpolation by quadratic functions.</div></body>
