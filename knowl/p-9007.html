<li><p>Find the tangent line to <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> and use this linearization to approximate <span class="process-math">\(e\text{.}\)</span> That is, find a formula <span class="process-math">\(L(x)\)</span> for the tangent line, and compute <span class="process-math">\(L(1)\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(L(1) \approx f(1) = e\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>The linearization of <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> does not provide a good approximation to <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> since 1 is not very close to 0. To obtain a better approximation, we alter our approach a bit. Instead of using a straight line to approximate <span class="process-math">\(e\text{,}\)</span> we put an appropriate bend in our estimating function to make it better fit the graph of <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> close to 0. With the linearization, we had both <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> share the same value as the linearization at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> We will now use a quadratic approximation <span class="process-math">\(P_2(x)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = e^x\)</span> centered at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\)</span> which has the property that <span class="process-math">\(P_2(0) = f(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P'_2(0) = f'(0)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\text{.}\)</span></p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Let <span class="process-math">\(P_2(x) = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}\text{.}\)</span> Show that <span class="process-math">\(P_2(0) = f(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P'_2(0) = f'(0)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P''_2(0) = f''(0)\text{.}\)</span> Then, use <span class="process-math">\(P_2(x)\)</span> to approximate <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> by observing that <span class="process-math">\(P_2(1) \approx f(1)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We can continue approximating <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> with polynomials of larger degree whose higher derivatives agree with those of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> at 0. This turns out to make the polynomials fit the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> better for more values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> around 0. For example, let <span class="process-math">\(P_3(x) = 1+x+\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{6}\text{.}\)</span> Show that <span class="process-math">\(P_3(0) = f(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P'_3(0) = f'(0)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P''_3(0) = f''(0)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P'''_3(0) = f'''(0)\text{.}\)</span> Use <span class="process-math">\(P_3(x)\)</span> to approximate <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> in a way similar to how you did so with <span class="process-math">\(P_2(x)\)</span> above.</p></li>
