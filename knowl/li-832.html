<div class="para">The value of a car is never negative. So we know that <span class="process-math">\(h(m) \geq 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span> A new car decreases in value very quickly at first, and as the car gets older with more mileage, its value will depreciate to near zero. So <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is a decreasing function. Since the value of our car always decreases, it follows that <span class="process-math">\(h'(m) \lt 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(m \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> The fact that the depreciation slows as <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> increases implies that <span class="process-math">\(h'\)</span> is an increasing (getting less negative) function. Since <span class="process-math">\(h'\)</span> is increasing, it follows that <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is bends upward; we will study this issue more in Section 1.6. So the graph of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> might have the general shape of the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = e^{-x}\)</span> for positive values of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
