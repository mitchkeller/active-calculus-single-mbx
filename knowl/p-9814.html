<div class="para">Stated more informally, the Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem tells us that when it comes to differentiating or integrating a Taylor series, we can do so just as if they were finite polynomials:  we can differentiate or integrate the Taylor series term-wise following the Power Rule for differentiating or integrating <span class="process-math">\(x^n\text{.}\)</span>  Moreover, doing so doesn't change the interval on which the Taylor series converges<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-133-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.5.2"><sup> 2 </sup></a>.  Since polynomials are the easiest of all functions to differentiate and integrate, we can now find many more Taylor series of interesting functions.</div>
