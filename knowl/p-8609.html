<p>Suppose you receive <span class="process-math">\(\dollar5000\)</span> through an inheritance. You decide to invest this money into a fund that pays <span class="process-math">\(8\%\)</span> annually, compounded monthly. That means that each month your investment earns <span class="process-math">\(\frac{0.08}{12} \cdot P\)</span> additional dollars, where <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is your principal balance at the start of the month. So in the first month your investment earns</p>

5000 \left(\frac{0.08}{12}\right)

<p class="continuation">or <span class="process-math">\(\dollar33.33\text{.}\)</span> If you reinvest this money, you will then have <span class="process-math">\(\dollar5033.33\)</span> in your account at the end of the first month. From this point on, assume that you reinvest all of the interest you earn.</p>
