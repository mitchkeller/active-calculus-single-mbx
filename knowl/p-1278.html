<div class="para">We have noted that <span class="process-math">\(F'\)</span> is always negative, and that we expect <span class="process-math">\(F'\)</span> to get closer and closer to <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> as time goes on (that is, <span class="process-math">\(F'\)</span> is increasing). As such, we expect <span class="process-math">\(F'\)</span> to look something like the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = -e^{-x}\text{.}\)</span> This is reasonable since <span class="process-math">\(-e^{-x}\)</span> is also an exponential function, is always negative, is always increasing, and approaches <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases.</div>
