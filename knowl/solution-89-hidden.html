<li><p>Since <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> raised to any power is always positive (and thus never <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span>), it follows that the only value that makes <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) = (x-1)e^{-x^2} = 0\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{.}\)</span> This is confirmed by plotting <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> where we only see the graph cross the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis at <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> (though we do see the graph approach the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis) as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases or decreases without bound).</p></li>
<li><p>We know that <span class="process-math">\(f''(x) \gt 0\)</span> wherever <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is increasing. From the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f'\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is increasing approximately on the interval <span class="process-math">\(-0.37 \lt x \lt 1.37\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is concave up on this interval.</p></li>
<li><p>The tangent line approximation at <span class="process-math">\(a = 2\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(L(x) = f(2) + f'(2)(x-2) \approx -3 + 0.01832(x-2)\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(f(1.88) \approx L(1.88) \approx -3 + 0.01832(1.88-2) = -3.00022\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f''(x) \lt 0\)</span> at and around <span class="process-math">\(x = 2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is concave down there, and therefore the tangent line lies above the curve. This makes our estimate larger than the true value of <span class="process-math">\(f(1.88)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
