<span class="process-math">\(t=0\)</span> the value of <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is 10. Since we are told that <span class="process-math">\(dy/dt=0.8 y\text{,}\)</span> we know that at time <span class="process-math">\(t=0\)</span> the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(0.8 (10) = 8\text{.}\)</span> Thus as <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> goes from 0 to 1, <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> will increase by 8, so at <span class="process-math">\(t=1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y=10 + 8 = 18\text{.}\)</span> Likewise, at <span class="process-math">\(t=1\text{,}\)</span> we get <span class="process-math">\({dy}/{dt} = 0.8 (18)=14.4\)</span> so that at <span class="process-math">\(t=2\text{,}\)</span> we obtain <span class="process-math">\(y=18 + 14.4 = 32.4\text{.}\)</span> At <span class="process-math">\(t=2\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(dy/dt=0.8 (32.4)=25.92\)</span> so that at <span class="process-math">\(t=3\text{,}\)</span> we obtain <span class="process-math">\(y=32.4 + 25.92 = 58.32\text{.}\)</span> Continuing similarly, <span class="process-math">\(dy/dt|_{t=3} = 46.656\text{,}\)</span> so that at <span class="process-math">\(t=4\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(y = 58.32 + 46.656 = 104.976\text{.}\)</span>
