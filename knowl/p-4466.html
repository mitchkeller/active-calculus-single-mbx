<div class="para">The reason that <span class="process-math">\(M_4\)</span> gives the exact area between the line and the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis is the rectangles with heights that come from the midpoint have the same area as the trapezoids that are formed by the function values at the two endpoints of each subinterval. We can also see this by observing that the ``extra area'' bounded by the midpoint rectangle exactly matches the ``missing area'' that is absent from the midpoint rectangle, as seen in the following figure. Since these two quantities balance out, the areas of the midpoint rectangles give us the exact area under the curve.</div>
