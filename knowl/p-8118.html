<p>Suppose that a cylindrical water tank with a hole in the bottom is filled with water. The water, of course, will leak out and the height of the water will decrease. Let <span class="process-math">\(h(t)\)</span> denote the height of the water. A physical principle called <em class="emphasis">Torricelli's Law</em> implies that the height decreases at a rate proportional to the square root of the height.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Express this fact using <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> as the constant of proportionality.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you have two tanks, one with <span class="process-math">\(k=-1\)</span> and another with <span class="process-math">\(k=-10\text{.}\)</span> What physical differences would you expect to find?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you have a tank for which the height decreases at <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> inches per minute when the water is filled to a depth of <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> inches. Find the value of <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Solve the initial value problem for the tank in part (c), and graph the solution you determine.</p></li>
<li><p>How long does it take for the water to run out of the tank?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the solution that you found valid for all time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{?}\)</span> If so, explain how you know this. If not, explain why not.</p></li>
