<li><p>Note that <span class="process-math">\(v(1) = 0\)</span> and for <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt t \lt 1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(v(t) \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> This means that on the interval <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\text{,}\)</span> the position function <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is increasing because velocity is positive.</p></li>
<li><p>We can check that the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(s(t) = 32t - 16t^2\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(s'(t) = v(t) = 32 - 32t\text{,}\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(s(0) = 0\text{,}\)</span> so this is the antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> that we desire.</p></li>
<li><p>Now, <span class="process-math">\(s(1) - s(\frac{1}{2}) = (32 - 16) - (16 - 4) = 4\text{,}\)</span> which is the change in position of the ball on the interval <span class="process-math">\([\frac{1}{2},1]\text{.}\)</span> Equivalently, since <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is positive through this interval, 4 feet is the vertical distance the ball traveled during this time.</p></li>
<li><p>On the interval from <span class="process-math">\(t = \frac{1}{2}\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(t = 1\text{,}\)</span> the corresponding area between the velocity curve and the <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis is the area of the right triangular region whose width is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> seconds and whose height is <span class="process-math">\(v(\frac{1}{2}) = 16\)</span> feet/sec. That area is therefore <span class="process-math">\(A = \frac{1}{2} bh = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot 16 = 4\)</span> feet. This is the total distance the ball traveled vertically on <span class="process-math">\([\frac{1}{2},1]\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(s(1) - s(0) = (32 - 16) - (0-0) = 16\text{,}\)</span> which is the vertical distance the ball traveled on the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{.}\)</span> The area between the velocity curve and the <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis on <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\)</span> is the area of the triangle with height 32 (ft/sec) and base 1 (second), which is <span class="process-math">\(A = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot 32 = 16\)</span> feet. These two results are identical, in part due to the fact that we are using two different perspectives to compute the same quantity, which is distance traveled.</p></li>
<li><p>Observe that <span class="process-math">\(s(2) - s(0) = (32 - 32) - (0 - 0) = 0\text{.}\)</span> This means that the ball has zero change in position on the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,2]\text{.}\)</span> But we already established that on the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{,}\)</span> the ball traveled 16 feet vertically; since the velocity becomes negative on the interval <span class="process-math">\(1 \lt t \lt 2\text{,}\)</span> there we know the ball's position is decreasing, so it is falling back to earth. The resulting zero change in position means that at <span class="process-math">\(t = 2\)</span> the ball has returned to the location from which it was tossed. If we view the area between the velocity function and the <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis as being negative wherever <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is negative, then we see that the areas of the two triangles involved are opposites, which in some sense results in the “total area” being zero, matching the change in position.</p></li>
