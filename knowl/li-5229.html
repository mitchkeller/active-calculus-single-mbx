<div class="para">Now we consider larger loans, e.g., automobile loans or mortgages, in which we borrow a specified amount of money over a specified period of time. In this situation, we need to determine the amount of the monthly payment we need to make to pay off the loan in the specified amount of time. In this situation, we need to find the monthly payment <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> that will take our outstanding principal to <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> in the specified amount of time. To do so, we want to know the value of <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> that makes <span class="process-math">\(P(t) = 0\)</span> in formulaÂ <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-loan2.html" title="Equation 8.2.9">(8.2.9)</a>. If we set <span class="process-math">\(P(t) = 0\)</span> and solve for <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> it follows that</div>

M = \frac{rP \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - 1 \right)}\text{.}
