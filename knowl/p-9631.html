<div class="para">In particular, for the degree <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> approximation, we see that <span class="process-math">\(T_9(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \sin(x)\)</span> are almost indistinguishable on <span class="process-math">\(-4 \lt x \lt 4\text{,}\)</span> which is much wider than the interval <span class="process-math">\(-2 \lt x \lt 2\)</span> on which the <span class="process-math">\(T_5(x)\)</span> approximation is accurate.  Increasing the degree of the approximation appears to widen the interval on which the approximation is accurate and seems to do so without bound, which suggests that the Taylor series of <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \sin(x)\)</span> in fact converges to <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \sin(x)\text{.}\)</span>
