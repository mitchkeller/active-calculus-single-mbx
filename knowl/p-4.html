<div class="para">David Farmer’s conversion script saved me hundreds of hours of work by taking my original <span class="latex-logo">L<span class="A">a</span>T<span class="E">e</span>X</span> source and converting it to PreTeXt; David remains a major source of ongoing support and advocacy. Alex Jordan of Portland Community College has also been a tremendous help, and it is through Alex’s fantastic work that live WeBWorK exercises are not only possible, but also included from the 2017 version forward. Mitch Keller of Morningside College agreed in early 2018 to serve as the book’s production editor; his technical expertise has contributed to many aspects of the book, including the presence of answers to activities and non- WeBWorK exercises and other supporting material for instructors.</div>
