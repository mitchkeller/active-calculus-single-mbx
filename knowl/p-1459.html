<p>Conditions (a) and (b) are technically contained implicitly in (c), but we state them explicitly to emphasize their individual importance. The definition says that a function is continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\)</span> provided that its limit as <span class="process-math">\(x \to a\)</span> exists and equals its function value at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{.}\)</span> If a function is continuous at every point in an interval <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{,}\)</span> we say the function is “continuous on <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{.}\)</span>” If a function is continuous at every point in its domain, we simply say the function is “continuous.” Thus, continuous functions are particularly nice: to evaluate the limit of a continuous function at a point, all we need to do is evaluate the function.</p>
