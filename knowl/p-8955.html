<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Recall that the amount of interest we pay each time depends on the principal that remains. How much interest, in terms of <span class="process-math">\(P_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> do we pay in the second installment?</p></li>
<li><p>How much of our second monthly installment goes to pay off the principal? What is the principal <span class="process-math">\(P_2\text{,}\)</span> or the balance of the loan, that we still have to pay off after making the second installment of the loan? Write your response in the form <span class="process-math">\(P_2 = ( \ )P_1 - ( \ )M\text{,}\)</span> where you fill in the parentheses.</p></li>
<li><p>Show that <span class="process-math">\(P_2 = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)^2P - \left[1 + \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)\right] M\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(P_3\)</span> be the amount of principal that remains after the third installment. Show that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
P_3 = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)^3P - \left[1 + \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right) + \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^2 \right] M\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we continue in the manner described in the problems above, then the remaining principal of our loan after <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> installments is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
P_n = \left(1 + \frac{r}{12}\right)^nP - \left[\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^k \right] M\text{.}\tag{8.2.7}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This is a rather complicated formula and one that is difficult to use. However, we can simplify the sum if we recognize part of  it as a partial sum of a geometric series. Find a formula for the sum</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
\displaystyle \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^k\text{.}\tag{8.2.8}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">and then a general formula for <span class="process-math">\(P_n\)</span> that does not involve a sum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is usually more convenient to write our formula for <span class="process-math">\(P_n\)</span> in terms of years rather than months. Show that <span class="process-math">\(P(t)\text{,}\)</span> the principal remaining after <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> years, can be written as</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation}
P(t) = \left(P - \frac{12M}{r}\right)\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} + \frac{12M}{r}\text{.}\tag{8.2.9}
\end{equation}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Now that we have analyzed the general loan situation, we apply formula <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-loan2.html" title="Equation 8.2.9">(8.2.9)</a> to an actual loan. Suppose we charge $1,000 on a credit card for holiday expenses. If our credit card charges 20% interest and we pay only the minimum payment of $25 each month, how long will it take us to pay off the $1,000 charge? How much in total will we have paid on this $1,000 charge? How much total interest will we pay on this loan?</p></li>
<li>
<p>Now we consider larger loans, e.g., automobile loans or mortgages, in which we borrow a specified amount of money over a specified period of time. In this situation, we need to determine the amount of the monthly payment we need to make to pay off the loan in the specified amount of time. In this situation, we need to find the monthly payment <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> that will take our outstanding principal to <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> in the specified amount of time. To do so, we want to know the value of <span class="process-math">\(M\)</span> that makes <span class="process-math">\(P(t) = 0\)</span> in formulaÂ <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-loan2.html" title="Equation 8.2.9">(8.2.9)</a>. If we set <span class="process-math">\(P(t) = 0\)</span> and solve for <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> it follows that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eq-loan2.html">
\begin{equation*}
M = \frac{rP \left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t}}{12\left(\left(1+\frac{r}{12}\right)^{12t} - 1 \right)}\text{.}
\end{equation*}

<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Suppose we want to borrow $15,000 to buy a car. We take out a 5 year loan at 6.25%. What will our monthly payments be? How much in total will we have paid for this $15,000 car? How much total interest will we pay on this loan?</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose you charge your books for winter semester on your credit card. The total charge comes to $525. If your credit card has an interest rate of 18% and you pay $20 per month on the card, how long will it take before you pay off this debt? How much total interest will you pay?</p></li>
<li>
<p>Say you need to borrow $100,000 to buy a house. You have several options on the loan:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>30 years at 6.5%</p></li>
<li><p>25 years at 7.5%</p></li>
<li><p>15 years at 8.25%.</p></li>
</ul>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>What are the monthly payments for each loan?</p></li>
<li><p>Which mortgage is ultimately the best deal (assuming you can afford the monthly payments)? In other words, for which loan do you pay the least amount of total interest?</p></li>
