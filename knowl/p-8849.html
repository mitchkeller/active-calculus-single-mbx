<div class="para">Consider the curve <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = 3 \cos(\frac{x^3}{4})\)</span> and the portion of its graph that lies in the first quadrant between the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis and the first positive value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = 0\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> denote the region bounded by this portion of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis, and the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis. Assume that <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> are each measured in feet.</div>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Picture the coordinate axes rotated <span class="process-math">\(90\)</span> degrees clockwise so that the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis points straight down, and the positive <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis points to the right. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> is rotated about the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis to form a solid of revolution, and we consider this solid as a storage tank. Suppose that the resulting tank is filled to a depth of <span class="process-math">\(1.5\)</span> feet with water weighing <span class="process-math">\(62.4\)</span> pounds per cubic foot. Find the amount of work required to lower the water in the tank until it is <span class="process-math">\(0.5\)</span> feet deep, by pumping the water to the top of the tank.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Again picture the coordinate axes rotated 90 degrees clockwise so that the positive <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis points straight down, and the positive <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis points to the right. Suppose that <span class="process-math">\(R\text{,}\)</span> together with its reflection across the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis, forms one end of a storage tank that is 10 feet long. Suppose that the resulting tank is filled completely with water weighing <span class="process-math">\(62.4\)</span> pounds per cubic foot. Find a formula for a function that tells the amount of work required to lower the water by <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> feet.</div></li>
