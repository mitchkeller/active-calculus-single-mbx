<p>As sand falls from the conveyor belt, several features of the sand pile will change: the volume of the pile will grow, the height will increase, and the radius will get bigger, too. All of these quantities are related to one another, and the rate at which each is changing is related to the rate at which sand falls from the conveyor.</p>
<p>We begin by identifying which variables are changing and how they are related. In this problem, we observe that the radius and height of the pile are related to its volume by the standard equation for the volume of a cone,</p>

<p>Viewing each of <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> as functions of <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> we differentiate implicitly to arrive at an equation that relates their respective rates of change. Taking the derivative of each side of the equation with respect to <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> we find</p>

<p>On the left, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{d}{dt}[V]\)</span> is simply <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dV}{dt}\text{.}\)</span> On the right, the situation is more complicated, as both <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> are implicit functions of <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> Hence we need the product and chain rules. We find that</p>

<p>(Note particularly how we are using ideas from <a href="sec-2-7-implicit.html" class="internal" title="Section 2.7: Derivatives of Functions Given Implicitly">SectionÂ 2.7</a> on implicit differentiation.
