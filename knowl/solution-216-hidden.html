<li><p>The fact that <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) \leq 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\)</span> means that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> cannot increase in this interval. So either <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is constant or <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> decreases somewhere in this interval. We can conclude that the global maximum value of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> occurs at <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> and the global minimum value at <span class="process-math">\(x=b\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The information we are given shows that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is increasing on <span class="process-math">\((a,c)\)</span> and decreasing on <span class="process-math">\((c,b)\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> has a global maximum value at <span class="process-math">\(x=c\text{.}\)</span> We know that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> must have a global minimum at either <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x=b\text{.}\)</span> The information given does not tell us how much <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> increases on <span class="process-math">\((a,c)\)</span> and decreases on <span class="process-math">\((c,b)\text{,}\)</span> so we cannot determine the endpoint at which <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> attains its global minimum value.</p></li>
<li><p>In order for <span class="process-math">\(h(a)=h(b)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h''(x) \lt 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{,}\)</span> the graph of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> must look something like a parabola that opens down on the interval <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{.}\)</span> Consequently, <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> has its global minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=b\text{,}\)</span> and its global maximum somewhere in <span class="process-math">\((a,b)\text{,}\)</span> but we do not know the exact point at which <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> attains its global maximum.</p></li>
<li><p>The given information forces the graph of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> to decrease on <span class="process-math">\((a,c)\)</span> then increase on <span class="process-math">\((c,b)\text{.}\)</span> Thus, we must have <span class="process-math">\(p(c) \lt p(b)\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> has its global minimum value at <span class="process-math">\(x=c\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(p(a) \gt p(b)\text{,}\)</span> this makes <span class="process-math">\(p(a)\)</span> the global maximum value of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
