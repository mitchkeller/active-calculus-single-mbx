<div class="para">Perhaps the simplest and most natural of all such curves are circles. Because of the circle's symmetry, for each <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> value strictly between the endpoints of the horizontal diameter, there are two corresponding <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-values. For instance, in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-2-7-Intro.html" title="Figure 2.7.1">Figure 2.7.1</a>, we have labeled <span class="process-math">\(A = (-3,\sqrt{7})\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(B = (-3,-\sqrt{7})\text{,}\)</span> and these points demonstrate that the circle fails the vertical line test. Hence, it is impossible to represent the circle through a single function of the form <span class="process-math">\(y = f(x)\text{.}\)</span> But portions of the circle can be represented explicitly as a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> such as the highlighted arc that is magnified in the center of <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-2-7-Intro.html" title="Figure 2.7.1">Figure 2.7.1</a>. Moreover, it is evident that the circle is locally linear, so we ought to be able to find a tangent line to the curve at every point. Thus, it makes sense to wonder if we can compute <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dy}{dx}\)</span> at any point on the circle, even though we cannot write <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> explicitly as a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
