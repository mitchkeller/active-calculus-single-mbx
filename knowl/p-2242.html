<div class="para">In addition to our usual <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> notation, there are other ways to denote the derivative of a function, as well as the instruction to take the derivative. If we are thinking about the relationship between <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we sometimes denote the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> by the symbol</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dy}{dx}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">which we read “dee-y dee-x.” For example, if <span class="process-math">\(y = x^2\text{,}\)</span> we’ll write that the derivative is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dy}{dx} = 2x\text{.}\)</span> This notation comes from the fact that the derivative is related to the slope of a line, and slope is measured by <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\text{.}\)</span> Note that while we read <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}\)</span> as “change in <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> over change in <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span>” we view <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dy}{dx}\)</span> as a single symbol, not a quotient of two quantities.</div>
