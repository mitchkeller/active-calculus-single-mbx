That is, the difference between 5.5 and 7, and between 6.25 and 7.  Thus, taking the magnitude of the differences, Error in Euler with two steps = 1.5, and Error in Euler with four steps = 0.75. <em class="alert">D.</em> Since we doubled the number of steps we took, we expect the error to drop by a factor of two (that is, the error in the Euler approximation with two steps should be twice as big as that with four), which it is.</div></body>
