<li><p>The critical numbers of a continuous function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> are the values of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(f'(p) = 0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(f'(p)\)</span> does not exist. These values are important because they identify horizontal tangent lines or corner points on the graph, which are the only possible locations at which a local maximum or local minimum can occur.</p></li>
<li><p>Given a differentiable function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is positive, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is increasing; whenever <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is negative, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is decreasing. The first derivative test tells us that at any point where <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> changes from increasing to decreasing, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a local maximum, while conversely at any point where <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> changes from decreasing to increasing <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a local minimum.</p></li>
<li><p>Given a twice differentiable function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> if we have a horizontal tangent line at <span class="process-math">\(x = p\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f''(p)\)</span> is nonzero, the sign of <span class="process-math">\(f''\)</span> tells us the concavity of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span>and hence whether <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a maximum or minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x = p\text{.}\)</span> In particular, if <span class="process-math">\(f'(p) = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f''(p) \lt 0\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is concave down at <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a local maximum there, while if <span class="process-math">\(f'(p) = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f''(p) \gt 0\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a local minimum at <span class="process-math">\(p\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(f'(p) = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f''(p) = 0\text{,}\)</span> then the second derivative does not tell us whether <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a local extreme at <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> or not.</p></li>
