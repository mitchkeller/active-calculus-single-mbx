<li><p>Through the method of integration by parts, we can evaluate indefinite integrals that involve products of basic functions such as <span class="process-math">\(\int x \sin(x) \, dx\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\int x \ln(x) \, dx\text{.}\)</span> Using a substitution enables us to trade one of the functions in the product for its derivative, and the other for its antiderivative, in an effort to find a different product of functions that is easier to integrate.</p></li>
<li>
<p>If the algebraic structure of an integrand is a product of basic functions in the form <span class="process-math">\(\int f(x) g'(x) \, dx\text{,}\)</span> we can use the substitution <span class="process-math">\(u = f(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv = g'(x) \,dx\)</span> and apply the rule</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\int u \, dv = uv - \int v \, du
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">to evaluate the original integral <span class="process-math">\(\int f(x) g'(x) \, dx\)</span> by instead evaluating</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\int v \, du = \int f'(x) g(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>When deciding to integrate by parts, we have to select both <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv\text{.}\)</span> That selection is guided by the overall principle that the new integral <span class="process-math">\(\int v \, du\)</span> not be more difficult than the original integral <span class="process-math">\(\int u \, dv\text{.}\)</span> In addition, it is often helpful to recognize if one of the functions present is much easier to differentiate than antidifferentiate (such as <span class="process-math">\(\ln(x)\)</span>), in which case that function often is best assigned the variable <span class="process-math">\(u\text{.}\)</span> In addition, <span class="process-math">\(dv\)</span> must be a function that we can antidifferentiate.</p></li>
