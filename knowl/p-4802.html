<div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">Itâ€™s not possible to say without more information: for instance, the functions <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = e^{-x}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = e^{-x}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x^2\)</span> are each always concave up, but only one of them has a global minimum. We can say for sure that by being always concave up, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> cannot have a global maximum, and it also cannot have both a global maximum and a global minimum. It might have a global minimum, or it might have neither.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">By being twice differentiable, we know that <span class="process-math">\(g'(x) = 0\)</span> any time <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is a critical number of <span class="process-math">\(g\text{.}\)</span> Thus, given the signs of <span class="process-math">\(g'(x)\)</span> on the stated intervals, <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is decreasing before <span class="process-math">\(x = a\)</span> and decreasing on <span class="process-math">\(a \lt x \lt b\text{,}\)</span> with a horizontal tangent line at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{.}\)</span> In addition, <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is increasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt b\text{.}\)</span> Thus, we know that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> has a global minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x = b\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is always decreasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt a\text{,}\)</span> always increasing for <span class="process-math">\(a \lt x \lt b\text{,}\)</span> and always decreasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt b\text{,}\)</span> we know that <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> has a local minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\)</span> and a local maximum at <span class="process-math">\(x = b\text{.}\)</span> Moreover, these local extremes are both global extremes since <span class="process-math">\(h(x) to 0\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x \to \pm \infty\text{.}\)</span> In particular, since <span class="process-math">\(h(x)\)</span> decreases to <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt b\)</span> and increases on <span class="process-math">\(a \lt x \lt b\text{,}\)</span> it follows that <span class="process-math">\(h(b)\)</span> is the largest value of <span class="process-math">\(h(x)\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\((a, \infty)\text{,}\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(h(b) \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, since <span class="process-math">\(h(x)\)</span> decreases on <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,
a)\)</span> and approaches <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x \to -\infty\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h(x)\)</span> increases on <span class="process-math">\(a \lt x \lt b\text{,}\)</span> it must be the case that <span class="process-math">\(h(a)\)</span> is the least value of <span class="process-math">\(h(x)\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\((-\infty,
b)\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(h(b) \lt 0\text{.}\)</span> Hence, <span class="process-math">\(h(x)\)</span> is always negative on <span class="process-math">\(x \lt a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h(x)\)</span> is always positive on <span class="process-math">\(x \gt b\text{.}\)</span> From all of these observations, it follows that <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> has a global minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\)</span> and a global maximum at <span class="process-math">\(x = b\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">First, observe that <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is defined for all real numbers by assumption, so <span class="process-math">\(p(a)\)</span> has some finite value. However, <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is not differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is concave up to the left of <span class="process-math">\(x = a\)</span> and concave down to the right of <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{.}\)</span> This indicates that <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> has a relative maximum at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{.}\)</span> Not enough information is provided, however, to determine if this relative maximum is a global maximum, nor if <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> happens to have a global minimum at some other point.</div></li>
