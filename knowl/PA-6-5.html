<p>A company with a large customer base has a call center that receives thousands of calls a day. After studying the data that represents how long callers wait for assistance, they find that the function <span class="process-math">\(p(t) = 0.25e^{-0.25t}\)</span> models the time customers wait in the following way: the fraction of customers who wait between <span class="process-math">\(t = a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(t = b\)</span> minutes is given by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\int_a^b p(t) \, dt\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Use this information to answer the following questions.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Determine the fraction of callers who wait between 5 and 10 minutes.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the fraction of callers who wait between 10 and 20 minutes.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Next, let's study the fraction who wait up to a certain number of minutes:</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>What is the fraction of callers who wait between 0 and 5 minutes?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the fraction of callers who wait between 0 and 10 minutes?</p></li>
<li><p>Between 0 and 15 minutes? Between 0 and 20?</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Let <span class="process-math">\(F(b)\)</span> represent the fraction of callers who wait between <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> minutes. Find a formula for <span class="process-math">\(F(b)\)</span> that involves a definite integral, and then use the First FTC to find a formula for <span class="process-math">\(F(b)\)</span> that does not involve a definite integral.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the value of the limit <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{b \to \infty} F(b)\text{?}\)</span> What is its meaning in the context of the problem?</p></li>
