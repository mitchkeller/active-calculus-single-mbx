<div class="para">One of the longest stretches of straight (and flat) road in North America can be found on the Great Plains in the state of North Dakota on state highway 46, which lies just south of the interstate highway I-94 and runs through the town of Gackle. A car leaves town (at time <span class="process-math">\(t = 0\)</span>) and heads east on highway 46; its position in miles (which should be typed as "mi") from Gackle at time <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in minutes (which should be typed as "min") is given by the graph of the function shown below. Three important points are labeled on the graph; where the curve looks linear, assume that it is indeed a straight line.</div>
