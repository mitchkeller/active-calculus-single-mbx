<div class="para">There are many different possible graphs for <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> Two of them are shown in the following figure. The blue graph is one possible version of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> that is continuous. Note that we can vertically shift that graph and its derivative will still be the given <span class="process-math">\(h'\text{.}\)</span> Moreover, we can vertically shift any of the piecewise linear portions of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> to generate a graph such as the one shown in red, which also has derivative <span class="process-math">\(h'\text{.}\)</span>
