<li><p>Setting <span class="process-math">\(v(t) = 0\text{,}\)</span> we find <span class="process-math">\(500 - 32t = 0\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(t = \frac{500}{32} = \frac{125}{8} = 15.625\text{.}\)</span> This is the time that the rocket's velocity changes from positive to negative, and thus the point when the rocket's position changes from increasing to decreasing: it's when the rocket reaches its maximum height.</p></li>
<li><p>Since <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is a positive linear function that connects the points <span class="process-math">\((0,500)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((15.625,0)\)</span> on the interval <span class="process-math">\([0, 15.625]\text{,}\)</span> the region enclosed by the velocity function and the <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis is a right triangle with vertical leg of length <span class="process-math">\(500\)</span> and horizontal leg of length <span class="process-math">\(15.625\text{.}\)</span> The area of this triangle is <span class="process-math">\(A = \frac{1}{2}bh = \frac{1}{2}(15.625)(500) = 3906.25\text{.}\)</span> Because this is the area under the velocity curve (where velocity is positive) this area represents the vertical distance traveled by the rocket on the time interval <span class="process-math">\([0, 15.625]\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>One function that has derivative <span class="process-math">\(v(t) = s'(t) = 500-32t\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(s(t) = 500t - 16t^2\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Using our result in (c), <span class="process-math">\(s(15.625) - s(0) = 500(15.625) - 16(15.625)^2 - (0 - 0) = 3906.25\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the change of the rocket's position on <span class="process-math">\([0,15.625]\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(3906.25\)</span> feet, which is also the distance the rocket traveled vertically on the time interval, since velocity is positive throughout.</p></li>
<li><p>We find that <span class="process-math">\(s(5) - s(1) = 1616\text{,}\)</span> which tells us that the rocket rose <span class="process-math">\(1616\)</span> feet on the <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span>-second interval from <span class="process-math">\(t = 1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(t = 5\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
