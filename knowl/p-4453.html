<p>The plot below shows that the rate of pollution appears to be increasing at an increasing rate as time goes on.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:25%;margin-right:25%;"><div class="sbspanel top" style="width:100%;"><img src="external/images/4_1_Ez4Soln.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div></div></div>
</li>
<li><p>If we think about an interval on which the rate of pollution is relatively constant and suppose the interval is <span class="process-math">\(\triangle t\)</span> wide, then the area under the curve on that interval is approximately the area of the rectangle whose width is <span class="process-math">\(\triangle t\)</span> and whose height is <span class="process-math">\(p(t)\text{,}\)</span> the polution rate on that interval. When we compute the product <span class="process-math">\(p(t) \cdot \triangle t\)</span> to find the area, the units involved are ``units of pollution per day'' times ``days'', which results in an overall unit of ``units of pollution''. Thus, the area under the curve tells us the total pollution emitted over the time interval <span class="process-math">\([0,30]\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>One way to estimate the total amount of pollution is to suppose the rate of pollution is constant on each of the intervals <span class="process-math">\([0,6]\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\([6,12]\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ldots\text{.}\)</span>  For instance, we could assume the rate on <span class="process-math">\([0,6]\)</span> is always <span class="process-math">\(7\)</span> units per day, and then the rate jumps to <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> units per day on <span class="process-math">\([6,12]\text{,}\)</span> and so on. Doing so, and using the ideas we discussed in (b), one estimate for the total pollution, <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
P = 7 \cdot 6 + 8 \cdot 6 + 10 \cdot 6 + 13 \cdot 6 + 18 \cdot 6 = 336
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">total units of pollution. Note, for example, that when we compute <span class="process-math">\(13 \cdot 6\)</span> this represents an estimate of the total amount of pollution emitted on the interval <span class="process-math">\([18,24]\)</span> since we are assuming the plant emits <span class="process-math">\(13\)</span> units of pollution per day for 6 days. It is apparent that this particular estimate is an underestimate of the total amount of pollution since the rate is always increasing but we are choosing the lowest value of that rate on a given interval.</p>
