<li><div class="para">The limit definition of the derivative, <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\text{,}\)</span> produces a value for each <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> at which the derivative is defined, and this leads to a new function <span class="process-math">\(y = f'(x)\text{.}\)</span> It is especially important to note that taking the derivative is a process that starts with a given function (<span class="process-math">\(f\)</span>) and produces a new, related function (<span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span>).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">There is essentially no difference between writing <span class="process-math">\(f'(a)\)</span> (as we did regularly in <a href="sec-1-3-derivative-pt.html" class="internal" title="Section 1.3: The derivative of a function at a point">Section 1.3</a>) and writing <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\text{.}\)</span> In either case, the variable is just a placeholder that is used to define the rule for the derivative function.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Given the graph of a function <span class="process-math">\(y = f(x)\text{,}\)</span> we can sketch an approximate graph of its derivative <span class="process-math">\(y = f'(x)\)</span> by observing that <em class="emphasis">heights</em> on the derivative's graph correspond to <em class="emphasis">slopes</em> on the original function's graph.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act-1-4-1.html" title="Activity 1.4.2">Activity 1.4.2</a>, we encountered some functions that had sharp corners on their graphs, such as the shifted absolute value function. At such points, the derivative fails to exist, and we say that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not differentiable there. For now, it suffices to understand this as a consequence of the jump that must occur in the derivative function at a sharp corner on the graph of the original function.</div></li>
