<div class="para">In words, the Sum Rule tells us that “the derivative of a sum is the sum of the derivatives.” It also tells us that a sum of two differentiable functions is also differentiable. Furthermore, because we can view the difference function <span class="process-math">\(y = (f-g)(x) = f(x) - g(x)\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(y = f(x) + (-1 \cdot g(x))\text{,}\)</span> the Sum Rule and Constant Multiple Rules together tell us that <span class="process-math">\(\frac{d}{dx}[f(x) + (-1 \cdot g(x))] = f'(x) - g'(x)\text{,}\)</span> or that “the derivative of a difference is the difference of the derivatives.” We can now compute derivatives of sums and differences of elementary functions.</div>
