<div class="para">Notice that the value of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is connected to the initial value of the velocity <span class="process-math">\(v(0)\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(v(0) = 3+C\text{.}\)</span> In other words, while the differential equation describes how the velocity changes as a function of the velocity itself, this is not enough information to determine the velocity uniquely: we also need to know the initial velocity. For this reason, differential equations will typically have infinitely many solutions, one corresponding to each initial value. We have seen this phenomenon before: given the velocity of a moving object <span class="process-math">\(v(t)\text{,}\)</span> we cannot uniquely determine the object's position function unless we also know its initial position.</div>
