<li><div class="para">Draw a picture and introduce variables. It is essential to first understand what quantities are allowed to vary in the problem and then to represent those values with variables. Constructing a figure with the variables labeled is almost always an essential first step. Sometimes drawing several diagrams can be especially helpful to get a sense of the situation. A nice example of this can be seen <a class="external" href="https://gvsu.edu/s/99" target="_blank">in this applet</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-55-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.4.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a>, where the choice of where to bend a piece of wire into the shape of a rectangle determines both the rectangle's shape and area.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Identify the quantity to be optimized as well as any key relationships among the variable quantities. Essentially this step involves writing equations that involve the variables that have been introduced: one to represent the quantity whose minimum or maximum is sought, and possibly others that show how multiple variables in the problem may be interrelated.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Determine a function of a single variable that models the quantity to be optimized; this may involve using other relationships among variables to eliminate one or more variables in the function formula. For example, in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA-3-4.html" title="Preview Activity 3.4.1">Preview Activity 3.4.1</a>, we initially found that <span class="process-math">\(V = x^2 y\text{,}\)</span> but then the additional relationship that <span class="process-math">\(4x + y = 108\)</span> (girth plus length equals 108 inches) allows us to relate <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> and thus observe equivalently that <span class="process-math">\(y = 108-4x\text{.}\)</span> Substituting for <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> in the volume equation yields <span class="process-math">\(V(x) = x^2(108-4x)\text{,}\)</span> and thus we have written the volume as a function of the single variable <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Decide the domain on which to consider the function being optimized. Often the physical constraints of the problem will limit the possible values that the independent variable can take on. Thinking back to the diagram describing the overall situation and any relationships among variables in the problem often helps identify the smallest and largest values of the input variable.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Use calculus to identify the absolute maximum and/or minimum of the quantity being optimized. This always involves finding the critical numbers of the function first. Then, depending on the domain, we either construct a first derivative sign chart (for an open or unbounded interval) or evaluate the function at the endpoints and critical numbers (for a closed, bounded interval), using ideas we've studied so far in <a href="C-3.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 3: Using Derivatives">Chapter 3</a>.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Finally, we make certain we have answered the question: does the question seek the absolute maximum of a quantity, or the values of the variables that produce the maximum? That is, finding the absolute maximum volume of a parcel is different from finding the dimensions of the parcel that produce the maximum.</div></li>
