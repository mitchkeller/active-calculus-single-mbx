<div class="para">Near the end of <a href="sec-8a-4-taylor-series.html" class="internal" title="Section 8.4: Taylor Series">Section 8.4</a>, we noted the important big-picture perspective that for familiar basic functions that are infinitely differentiable, such as <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \sin(x)\text{,}\)</span> not only can we find the function’s Taylor series and determine the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-values for which the Taylor series converges, but <em class="emphasis">the Taylor series converges to the function itself</em>.  Furthermore, we noted that these representations play a key role in how computers provide decimal approxations to quantities such as <span class="process-math">\(\sin(1)\text{,}\)</span> which can be represented as</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/sec-8a-4-taylor-series.html">
\begin{equation*}
\sin(1) = 1 - \frac{1}{3!} + \frac{1}{5!} - \frac{1}{7!} + \cdots\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">Our most recent work with Taylor series shows that the news is better still:  now we can easily represent even more complicated functions with Taylor series, such as <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = e^{-x^2}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = \sin(x^2)\text{,}\)</span> and determine their antiderivatives using their infinite Taylor series and treating that representation just like a polynomial.  In the last portion of this section, we investigate further how certain infinite series of numbers can be easily and accurately approximated using partial sums that result from evaluating Taylor series.</div>
