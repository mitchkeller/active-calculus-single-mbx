<p>In <a href="C-7.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 7: Differential Equations">ChapterÂ 7</a>, we learned some of the many important applications of differential equations, and learned some approaches to solve or analyze them. Here, we consider an important approach that will allow us to solve a wider variety of differential equations.</p>
<p>Let's consider the familiar differential equation from exponential population growth given by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eq-PA-8-6-Resistance-ode.html">
\begin{equation}
y' = ky\text{,}\tag{8.6.1}
\end{equation}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> is the constant of proportionality. While we can solve this differential equation using methods we have already learned, we take a different approach now that can be applied to a much larger set of differential equations. For the rest of this activity, let's assume that <span class="process-math">\(k=1\text{.}\)</span> We will use our knowledge of Taylor series to find a solution to the differential equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-PA-8-6-Resistance-ode.html" title="Equation 8.6.1">(8.6.1)</a>.</p>
<p>To do so, we assume that we have a solution <span class="process-math">\(y=f(x)\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> has a Taylor series that can be written in the form</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
y = f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_kx^k\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where the coefficients <span class="process-math">\(a_k\)</span> are undetermined. Our task is to find the coefficients.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>
<p>Assume that we can differentiate a power series term by term. By taking the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and substituting the result into the differential equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-PA-8-6-Resistance-ode.html" title="Equation 8.6.1">(8.6.1)</a>, show that the equation</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/eq-PA-8-6-Resistance-ode.html">
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} ka_kx^{k-1} = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_kx^{k}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">must be satisfied in order for <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} a_kx^k\)</span> to be a solution of the DE.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two series are equal if and only if they have the same coefficients on like power terms. Use this fact to find a relationship between <span class="process-math">\(a_1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a_0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Now write <span class="process-math">\(a_2\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(a_1\text{.}\)</span> Then write <span class="process-math">\(a_2\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(a_0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Write <span class="process-math">\(a_3\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(a_2\text{.}\)</span> Then write <span class="process-math">\(a_3\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(a_0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Write <span class="process-math">\(a_4\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(a_3\text{.}\)</span> Then write <span class="process-math">\(a_4\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(a_0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Observe that there is a pattern in (b)-(e). Find a general formula for <span class="process-math">\(a_k\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(a_0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Write the series expansion for <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> using only the unknown coefficient <span class="process-math">\(a_0\text{.}\)</span> From this, determine what familiar functions satisfy the differential equation <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/eq-PA-8-6-Resistance-ode.html" title="Equation 8.6.1">(8.6.1)</a>. (<em class="emphasis">Hint</em>: Compare to a familiar Taylor series.)</p></li>
