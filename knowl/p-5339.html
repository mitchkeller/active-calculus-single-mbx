<div class="para">Now suppose she walks in the following manner. From the outset at <span class="process-math">\(t = 0\text{,}\)</span> she walks due east at a constant rate of <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> mph for 1.5 hours. After 1.5 hours, she stops abruptly and begins walking due west at a constant rate of <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> mph and does so for 0.5 hours. Then, after another abrupt stop and start, she resumes walking at a constant rate of <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> mph to the east for one more hour. What is the total distance she traveled on the time interval from <span class="process-math">\(t = 0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(t = 3\text{?}\)</span> What is the total change in her position over that time?</div>
