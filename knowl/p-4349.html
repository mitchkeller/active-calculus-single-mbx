<div class="para">Based on where <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> has horizontal tangent lines and where its slope is positive and negative, we can sketch an approximate graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = f''(x)\)</span> in the usual way that we sketch the derivative of a given function. From the given graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = f'(x)\text{,}\)</span> we can see that <span class="process-math">\(f''(x) = 0\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x \approx -0.35\)</span> and at <span class="process-math">\(x = 1\text{,}\)</span> and that between these points, <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> is negative because <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> is decreasing, while <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> is positive everywhere else since <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> is increasing everywhere else. A possible graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = f''(x)\)</span> is shown at right in the following figure.</div>
