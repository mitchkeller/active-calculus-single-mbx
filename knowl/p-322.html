<p>As <span class="process-math">\(x \to 0\text{,}\)</span> we observe that <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\pi}{x}\)</span> does not behave in an elementary way. When <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is positive and approaching zero, we are dividing by smaller and smaller positive values, and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\pi}{x}\)</span> increases without bound. When <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is negative and approaching zero, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\pi}{x}\)</span> decreases without bound. In this sense, as we get close to <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{,}\)</span> the inputs to the sine function are growing rapidly, and this leads to increasingly rapid oscillations in the graph of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> betweem <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{.}\)</span> If we plot the function <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{x}\right)\)</span> with a graphing utility and then zoom in on <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{,}\)</span> we see that the function never settles down to a single value near the origin, which suggests that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> does not have a limit at <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{.}\)</span></p>
