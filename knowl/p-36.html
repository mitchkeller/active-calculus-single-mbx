<div class="para">The best way to be successful in mathematics generally and calculus specifically is to strive to make sense of the main ideas.  We make sense of ideas by asking questions, interacting with others, attempting to solve problems, making mistakes, revising attempts, and writing and speaking about our understanding.  This text has been designed to help you make sense of calculus; we wish you the very best as you undertake the large and challenging task of doing so.</div>
