<div class="para">We expect the coffee’s temperature to decrease quickly early on when the difference between its temperature and the surroundings is greatest, and as time goes on for the coffee’s temperature to approach that of the surrounding room. Keeping in mind that <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is an always decreasing function so that <span class="process-math">\(F'\)</span> is always negative, we observe that <span class="process-math">\(F'(10)\)</span> should be less (more negative) than <span class="process-math">\(F'(20)\text{.}\)</span> These observations can also be confirmed by plotting a graph of <span class="process-math">\(F\text{.}\)</span>
