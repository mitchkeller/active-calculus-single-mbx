<div class="para">Suppose you drop a golf ball onto a hard surface from a height <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> The collision with the ground causes the ball to lose energy and so it will not bounce back to its original height. The ball will then fall again to the ground, bounce back up, and continue. Assume that at each bounce the ball rises back to a height <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3}{4}\)</span> of the height from which it dropped. Let <span class="process-math">\(h_n\)</span> be the height of the ball on the <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>th bounce, with <span class="process-math">\(h_0 = h\text{.}\)</span> In this exercise we will determine the distance traveled by the ball and the time it takes to travel that distance.</div>
