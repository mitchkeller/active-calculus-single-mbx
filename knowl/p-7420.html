<div class="para">We have learned two antidifferentiation techniques: <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution and integration by parts. The former is used to reverse the chain rule, while the latter to reverse the product rule. But we have seen that each works only in specialized circumstances. For example, while <span class="process-math">\(\int xe^{x^2} \, dx\)</span> may be evaluated by <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution and <span class="process-math">\(\int x e^x \, dx\)</span> by integration by parts, neither method provides a route to evaluate <span class="process-math">\(\int e^{x^2} \, dx\text{,}\)</span> and in fact an elementary algebraic antiderivative for <span class="process-math">\(e^{x^2}\)</span> does not exist. No antidifferentiation method will provide us with a simple algebraic formula for a function <span class="process-math">\(F(x)\)</span> that satisfies <span class="process-math">\(F'(x) = e^{x^2}\text{.}\)</span>
