We are interested in understanding how fast his shadow is changing at various points in time.</div>

<li><div class="para">Draw an appropriate right triangle that represents a snapshot in time of the skateboarder, lamppost, and his shadow. Let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> denote the horizontal distance from the base of the lamppost to the skateboarder and <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> represent the length of his shadow. Label these quantities, as well as the skateboarder's height and the lamppost's height on the diagram.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Observe that the skateboarder and the lamppost represent parallel line segments in the diagram, and thus similar triangles are present.
