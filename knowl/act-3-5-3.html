<p>As pictured in the <a class="external" href="https://gvsu.edu/s/9q" target="_blank">applet</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-68-hidden.html" title="Footnote 3.5.8"><sup> 8 </sup></a>, a skateboarder who is 6 feet tall rides under a 15 foot tall lamppost at a constant rate of 3 feet per second. We are interested in understanding how fast his shadow is changing at various points in time.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Draw an appropriate right triangle that represents a snapshot in time of the skateboarder, lamppost, and his shadow. Let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> denote the horizontal distance from the base of the lamppost to the skateboarder and <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> represent the length of his shadow. Label these quantities, as well as the skateboarder's height and the lamppost's height on the diagram.</p></li>
<li><p>Observe that the skateboarder and the lamppost represent parallel line segments in the diagram, and thus similar triangles are present. Use similar triangles to establish an equation that relates <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Use your work in (b) to find an equation that relates <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dx}{dt}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\frac{ds}{dt}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>At what rate is the length of the skateboarder's shadow increasing at the instant the skateboarder is 8 feet from the lamppost?</p></li>
<li><p>As the skateboarder's distance from the lamppost increases, is his shadow's length increasing at an increasing rate, increasing at a decreasing rate, or increasing at a constant rate?</p></li>
<li><p>Which is moving more rapidly: the skateboarder or the tip of his shadow? Explain, and justify your answer.</p></li>
