<p>Finally, before proceeding to build a list of common functions whose antiderivatives we know, we recall that each function has more than one antiderivative. Because the derivative of any constant is zero, we may add a constant of our choice to any antiderivative. For instance, we know that <span class="process-math">\(G(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3\)</span> is an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = x^2\text{.}\)</span> But we could also have chosen <span class="process-math">\(G(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + 7\text{,}\)</span> since in this case as well, <span class="process-math">\(G'(x) = x^2\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = x^2\text{,}\)</span> we say that the <em class="emphasis">general antiderivative</em>  of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
G(x) = \frac{1}{3}x^3 + C\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">where <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> represents an arbitrary real number constant. Regardless of the formula for <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> including <span class="process-math">\(+C\)</span> in the formula for its antiderivative <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> results in the most general possible antiderivative.</p>
