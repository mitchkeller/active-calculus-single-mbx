<li><div class="para">By finding the area of the triangular regions formed between <span class="process-math">\(y = v(t)\)</span> and the <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis on <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\([1,2]\)</span> (each of which is <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>), it follows that the object's total distance traveled is <span class="process-math">\(2\text{,}\)</span> while its change in position is <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> The latter is true since the net signed area bounded by <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\([0,2]\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(1 - 1 = 0\text{.}\)</span>  Finally, the object's position at <span class="process-math">\(t = 2\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(s(2) = 1\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The object's position is increasing wherever its velocity is positive, hence for <span class="process-math">\(0 \le t \lt 1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(4 \lt t \lt 8 \text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">By calculating the area bounded by the curve, we find 1 unit of area on <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{,}\)</span> 4 units of area on <span class="process-math">\([1,4]\text{,}\)</span> and 8 units of area on <span class="process-math">\([4,8]\text{,}\)</span> thus the total distance traveled on <span class="process-math">\(0 \le t \le 8\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(D = 1 + 4 + 8\)</span> meters. As the change in position is given by the net signed area on this interval, we find that the change in position is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
s(8) - s(0) = 1 - 4 + 8 = 5 \ \mbox{m}\text{.}

<div class="para">We thus observe that the distance traveled and change in position on <span class="process-math">\([0,8]\)</span> are different.</div>

<li><div class="para">In the figure below, at left we list all of the areas bounded by <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> on each one-unit subinterval. Along with the given starting point that <span class="process-math">\(s(0) = 1\text{,}\)</span> we use the resulting changes in position to plot points for the function <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span> For instance, we know <span class="process-math">\(s(1) - s(0) = 1\text{,}\)</span> hence <span class="process-math">\(s(1) = 2\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, <span class="process-math">\(s(2) - s(1) = -1\text{,}\)</span> thus <span class="process-math">\(s(2) = 1\text{.}\)</span> Continuing across the interval, we generate the function <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> that is pictured at right. Note that the portion of <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> from <span class="process-math">\(t = 2\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(t = 3\)</span> is linear because <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is constant there, while the other parts of <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> appear to be quadratic, as they correspond to intervals where <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is linear.</div></li>
