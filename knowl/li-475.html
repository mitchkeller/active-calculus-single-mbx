<div class="para">For <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = x^2 - x + 3\text{,}\)</span> we found that <span class="process-math">\(g'(x) = 2x - 1\text{.}\)</span> For <span class="process-math">\(p(x) = 5x^2 - 4x + 12\text{,}\)</span> we determined that <span class="process-math">\(p'(x) = 10x - 4\text{.}\)</span> The constants <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(12\)</span> don't seem to affect the results at all, and that makes sense because those numbers only serve to shift the graphs of <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> vertically, which does nothing to change the slope. The coefficient <span class="process-math">\(-4\)</span> on the linear term in <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\)</span> appears to make the ``<span class="process-math">\(-4\)</span>'' appear in <span class="process-math">\(p'(x)= 10x - 4\text{.}\)</span> That, too, makes sense in light of the fact that if we considered only the linear function <span class="process-math">\(L(x) = -4x\text{,}\)</span> the slope would everywhere be <span class="process-math">\(-4\text{,}\)</span> in contrast to the coefficent <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> found on the linear term in <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = x^2 - x + 3\text{,}\)</span> which leads to the constant <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(g'(x) = 2x - 1\text{.}\)</span> Finally, the leading coefficient <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\((x) = 5x^2 - 4x + 12\)</span> leads to the coefficient of ``<span class="process-math">\(10\)</span>'' in <span class="process-math">\(p'(x) = 10x -4\text{.}\)</span> This makes sense because if we considered only <span class="process-math">\(y = 5x^2\text{,}\)</span> the <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> would make the graph <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> times as steep as the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = x^2\text{,}\)</span> and thus it affects the derivative proportionately.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-1-4-derivative-fxn.html#li-475" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
