<li><p>The function <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> must be piecewise linear since its derivative is piecewise constant. That is, wherever <span class="process-math">\(h'\)</span> is constant, <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> must be linear. In particular, <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> must be piecewise linear with slope of <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{,}\)</span> depending on the interval.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(h'(x)\)</span> is not defined for <span class="process-math">\(x = -2, 0, 2\text{,}\)</span> as reflected by the open circles on the graph of <span class="process-math">\(h'\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>It is possible that <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is not continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x = -2, 0, 2\text{,}\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is not differentiable at these points; everywhere else, <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> must be continuous.</p></li>
<li>
<p>There are many different possible graphs for <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> Two of them are shown in the following figure. The blue graph is one possible version of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> that is continuous. Note that we can vertically shift that graph and its derivative will still be the given <span class="process-math">\(h'\text{.}\)</span> Moreover, we can vertically shift any of the piecewise linear portions of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> to generate a graph such as the one shown in red, which also has derivative <span class="process-math">\(h'\text{.}\)</span></p>
