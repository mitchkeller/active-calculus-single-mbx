<p>Both integration techniques we have discussed apply in relatively limited circumstances. It is not hard to find examples of functions for which neither technique produces an antiderivative; indeed, there are many, many functions that appear elementary but that do not have an elementary algebraic antiderivative. For instance, neither <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution nor integration by parts proves fruitful for the indefinite integrals</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\int e^{x^2} \, dx \ \ \text{and}  \ \ \int x \tan(x) \, dx\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">While there are other integration techniques, some of which we will consider briefly, none of them enables us to find an algebraic antiderivative for <span class="process-math">\(e^{x^2}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x \tan(x)\text{.}\)</span> We do know from the Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that we can construct an integral antiderivative for each function; <span class="process-math">\(F(x) = \int_0^x e^{t^2} \, dt\)</span> is an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = e^{x^2}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(G(x) = \int_0^{x} t \tan(t) \, dt\)</span> is an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(g(x) = x \tan(x)\text{.}\)</span> But finding an elementary algebraic formula that doesn't involve integrals for either <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(G\)</span> turns out not only to be impossible through <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution or integration by parts, but indeed impossible altogether. Antidifferentiation is much harder in general than differentiation.</p>
