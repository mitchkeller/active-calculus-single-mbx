<div class="para">If <span class="process-math">\(C(2000) = 800\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C'(2000) = 0.35\text{,}\)</span> then we know once 2000 feet of rope are produced, the total cost function is increasing at $0.35 per additional foot of rope. Then, if we manufacture an additional 100 feet of rope, the additional total cost will be approximately</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
100 \ \text{feet}  \cdot 0.35 \ \frac{\text{dollars} }{\text{foot} } = 35 \ \text{dollars}\text{.}

<div class="para">Therefore, we find that <span class="process-math">\(C(2100) \approx C(2000) + 35 = 835\text{,}\)</span> or that the cost to make 2100 feet of rope is about $835.</div>

Said differently, the instantaneous rate of change of the total cost function should either be constant or decrease due to economy of scale.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">It is impossible to have <span class="process-math">\(C'(5000) = -0.1\)</span> and indeed to have any negative derivative value for the total cost function. The total cost function <span class="process-math">\(C(r)\)</span> can never decrease, because it doesn't make sense for the total cost of producing 5001 feet of rope to be less than the total cost of producing 5000 feet of rope.</div></li>
