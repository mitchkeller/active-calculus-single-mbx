<div class="para">Thus, the First FTC can be used in two ways. First, to find the difference <span class="process-math">\(F(b) - F(a)\)</span> for an antiderivative <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> of the integrand <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> even if we may not have a formula for <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> itself. To do this, we must know the value of the integral <span class="process-math">\(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\)</span> exactly, perhaps through known geometric formulas for area. In addition, the First FTC provides a way to find the exact value of a definite integral, and hence a certain net signed area exactly, by finding an antiderivative of the integrand and evaluating its total change over the interval. In this case, we need to know a formula for the antiderivative <span class="process-math">\(F\text{.}\)</span> Both of these perspectives are reflected in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-5-2-Intro.html" title="Figure 5.2.1">FigureÂ 5.2.1</a>.</div>
