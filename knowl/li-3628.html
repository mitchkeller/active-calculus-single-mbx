<div class="para">The Midpoint Rule is typically twice as accurate as the Trapezoid Rule, and the signs of the respective errors of these rules are opposites. Hence, by taking the weighted average <span class="process-math">\(S_{2n} = \frac{2M_n + T_n}{3}\text{,}\)</span> we can build a much more accurate approximation to <span class="process-math">\(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\)</span> by using approximations we have already computed. The rule for <span class="process-math">\(S_{2n}\)</span> is known as Simpson's Rule, which can also be developed by approximating a given continuous function with pieces of quadratic polynomials.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-5-6-num-int.html#boQ" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
