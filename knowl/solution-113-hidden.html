<li><div class="para">The function <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is differentiable at points where its graph is locally linear or smooth. Since there are sharp corners in the graph of <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=1\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is not differentiable at those points. Similarly, the sharp corners in <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=-1\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x=1\)</span> mean that <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is not differentiable at these points, either.</div></li>
