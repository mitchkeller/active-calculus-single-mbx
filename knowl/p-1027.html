<div class="para">The meaning of the derivative function still holds, so when we compute <span class="process-math">\(y = f''(x)\text{,}\)</span> this new function measures slopes of tangent lines to the curve <span class="process-math">\(y = f'(x)\text{,}\)</span> as well as the instantaneous rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(y = f'(x)\text{.}\)</span> In other words, just as the first derivative measures the rate at which the original function changes, the second derivative measures the rate at which the first derivative changes. The second derivative will help us understand how the rate of change of the original function is itself changing.</div>
