<p class="continuation">Note that this is the same polynomial as <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{,}\)</span> which is not surprising since the degree 3 Taylor polynomial is the degree 3 polynomial that has the same value, slope, concavity, and third derivative at <span class="process-math">\(a = 0\)</span> as the original.</p>
