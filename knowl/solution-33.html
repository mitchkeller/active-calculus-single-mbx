<em class="alert">A.</em> Recall that the derivative is positive when the function is increasing.  So we’re looking for a point on the graph where the function is increasing; one such point is <span class="process-math">\(x = 1\text{.}\)</span> <em class="alert">B.</em> The function is positive when the function is above the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-axis.  One such point is <span class="process-math">\(x = 1.5\text{.}\)</span> <em class="alert">C.</em> The derivative of the function is largest when the function is increasing the fastest. This occurs at <span class="process-math">\(x \approx 3.25\text{.}\)</span> <em class="alert">D.</em> The derivative of the function is zero when the function has a horizontal tangent.  One such point is <span class="process-math">\(x \approx 1.45\text{.}\)</span> <em class="alert">E.</em> Finally, we’re looking for a point where the derivative is the same as the derivative at <span class="process-math">\(x = 0.75\text{.}\)</span>  This means that we want the slope of a tangent to the curve to be approximately the same as it is at <span class="process-math">\(x = 0.75\text{.}\)</span>  Such a point is <span class="process-math">\(x = 3.25\text{.}\)</span>
