<li>
<p>Looking at the composite functions that are present, there are two possible <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitutions to try. One is <span class="process-math">\(u = 1+x^2\text{,}\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(du = 2x \, dx\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x = \sqrt{u-1}\text{.}\)</span> Because there is no <span class="process-math">\(x \, dx\)</span> term present in the integral, this substitution will not work.</p>
<p>A second subsitution to attempt is letting <span class="process-math">\(u = x + \sqrt{1+x^2}\text{,}\)</span> for which <span class="process-math">\(du = \left(1 + x(1+x^2)^{-1/2} \right) \, dx\text{.}\)</span> Here, too, the needed product is not present in the integral in order for the subsitution to work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For integration by parts to work, we normally need a choice of <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> that is straightforward to differentiate, and <span class="process-math">\(dv\)</span> that is straightforward to antidifferentiate. Noting that the integrand can really only be written as the product of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}\text{,}\)</span> it appears that the most natural possible option is to let <span class="process-math">\(u = \sqrt{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\text{,}\)</span> since we can antidifferentiate <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{x}\text{.}\)</span> Here, however, the approach stalls, because integration by parts requires us to evaluate <span class="process-math">\(\int v \, du\text{,}\)</span> and that integral is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\int \ln|x| \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left( x + \sqrt{1+x^2} \right)^{-1/2} \cdot \left( 1 + x(1+x^2)^{-1/2} \right) \, dx
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which is far more complicated than the already-complicated integral we started with. From this it appears that integration by parts will not be productive.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Since we can't seem to find a <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution that simplifies the given integral, and there are no formulas in the Appendix that use nested square roots, it appears that the table doesn't offer any help in evaluating this particular integral.</p></li>
<li><p>WolframAlpha returns results that either involve inverse hyperbolic trigonometric functions or complex numbers. As such, it appears that the function <span class="process-math">\(\frac{\sqrt{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}}{x}\)</span> does not have an elementary antiderivative that we can find.</p></li>
