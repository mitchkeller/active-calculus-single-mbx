<p>To explain the meaning of these function and derivative values to someone who doesn't know calculus, we could say something like the following:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p>The given values of <span class="process-math">\(f(80) = 0.05\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f'(80) = 0.0004\)</span> tell us that when the car is going <span class="process-math">\(80\)</span> kilometers per hour, it is using <span class="process-math">\(0.05\)</span> liters of fuel for every kilometer it travels. In addition, for each additional kilometer per hour of velocity above <span class="process-math">\(80\)</span> kph, we expect that the car will use about an additional <span class="process-math">\(0.0004\)</span> liters of fuel per kilometer.</p></li>
<li><p>The values of <span class="process-math">\(g(80) = 20\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g'(80) = -0.16\)</span> tell us that when the car is going <span class="process-math">\(80\)</span> kilometers per hour, it is able to travel <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> kilometers for each liter of fuel used. In addition, for each additional kilometer per hour of velocity above <span class="process-math">\(80\)</span> kph, we expect that the car will be able to travel about <span class="process-math">\(0.16\)</span> fewer kilometers per liter of fuel.</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, the values of <span class="process-math">\(h(80) = 4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h'(80) = 0.82\)</span> tell us that when the car is going <span class="process-math">\(80\)</span> kilometers per hour, it is using <span class="process-math">\(4\)</span> liters of fuel for every hour it travels. In addition, for each additional kilometer per hour of velocity above <span class="process-math">\(80\)</span> kph, we expect that the car will ues about <span class="process-math">\(0.082\)</span> more liters of fuel per hour.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="continuation">Note that all three of these observations are saying fundamentally the same thing, just from different perspectives: the first regards fuel consumption measured in liters per kilometer; the second regards fuel consumption in kilometers per liter; and the last regards fuel consumption in liters per hour.</p>
