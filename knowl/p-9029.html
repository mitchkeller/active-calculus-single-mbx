<p>Is it even possible to sum an infinite list of numbers? That doing so is possible in some situations shouldn't come as a surprise. We have already examined the special case of geometric series in the previous section. Moreover, the definite integral is defined as the limit of a sequence of finite sums, which provides insight into how we'll think of infinite sums generally. As we investigate other infinite sums, there are two key questions we seek to answer: (1) is the sum finite? and (2) if yes, what is its value?</p>
