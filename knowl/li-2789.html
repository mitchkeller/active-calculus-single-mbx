<div class="para">The velocity function of the biker tells us that for the first hour, the biker pedals north at a velocity of <span class="process-math">\(11\)</span> miles per hour. At the <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>-hour mark, the biker abruptly changes direction and then pedals south at <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> miles per hour for the next two hours; finally, at the <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span>-hour mark, the biker again changes direction and then pedals north at <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> mph for the last hour of their trip.</div>
<div class="para">Thus, the biker traveled <span class="process-math">\(11\)</span> miles north from their starting point (mile <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span>) and thus made the turn at <span class="process-math">\(t = 1\)</span> at mile <span class="process-math">\(12\text{.}\)</span> Two hours later, having pedaled south at <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> mph, they’d traveled <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> miles south, and thus were at mile <span class="process-math">\(12 - 20 = -8\)</span> relative to Pigeon Lake. Finally, after biking at <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> mph north for the lat hour, they were back at mile <span class="process-math">\(-8 + 9 = 1\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
<div class="para">The furthest north the biker was occurred at time <span class="process-math">\(t = 1\text{.}\)</span> This occurs because it is the only time when the derivative of the biker’s position function changes from positive to negative, and thus <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> has a local maximum. In addition, we can see this based on our discussion above of how far the biker traveled in each direction on the various time intervals, and that the biker was <span class="process-math">\(12\)</span> miles north of the lake at <span class="process-math">\(t = 1\text{.}\)</span>
