<div class="para">We know from experience that the deeper one dives underwater while swimming, the greater the pressure exerted by the water. This is because at a greater depth, there is more water right on top of the swimmer: it is the force that “column” of water exerts that determines the pressure the swimmer experiences. The total water pressure is found by computing the total weight of the column of water that lies above a region of area 1 square foot at a fixed depth. At a depth of <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> feet, a rectangular column has volume <span class="process-math">\(V = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot d\)</span> ft<span class="process-math">\(^3\text{,}\)</span> so the corresponding weight of the water overhead is <span class="process-math">\(62.4d\text{.}\)</span> This is the amount of force being exerted on a 1 square foot region at a depth <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> feet underwater, so the pressure exerted by water at depth <span class="process-math">\(d\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(P = 62.4 d\)</span> (lbs/ft<span class="process-math">\(^2\)</span>).</div>
