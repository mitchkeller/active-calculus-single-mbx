(Note: although <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> changes from decreasing to increasing at <span class="process-math">\(x = 2\text{,}\)</span> this is due to a vertical asymptote, and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> does not have a minimum there.)</div></li>

For <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is always increasing, which suggests that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> does not have a global maximum (though we do not know for sure that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> increases without bound).</div></li>
