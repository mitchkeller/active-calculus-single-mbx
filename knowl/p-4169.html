<p>A baseball diamond is <span class="process-math">\(90'\)</span> square. A batter hits a ball along the third base line and runs to first base. At what rate is the distance between the ball and first base changing when the ball is halfway to third base, if at that instant the ball is traveling <span class="process-math">\(100\)</span> feet/sec? At what rate is the distance between the ball and the runner changing at the same instant, if at the same instant the runner is <span class="process-math">\(1/8\)</span> of the way to first base running at <span class="process-math">\(30\)</span> feet/sec?</p>
