<li><p>Note that since <span class="process-math">\(h(z) = z^{1/2} + z^{-1}\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(h'(z) = \frac{1}{2}z^{-1/2} - z^{-2}\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(h'(4) = \frac{1}{2(4)^{1/2}} - \frac{1}{4^2} = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{16} = \frac{3}{16}\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the slope of the tangent line to <span class="process-math">\(h(z)\)</span> at the point where <span class="process-math">\(z = 4\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{3}{16}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>For (i.), note that <span class="process-math">\(P'(t) = 2(1.37)^t \ln(1.37)\text{,}\)</span> and therefore <span class="process-math">\(P'(4) = 2(1.37)^4 \ln(1.37) \approx 2.218\)</span> million cells per day. For (ii.), we can compute <span class="process-math">\(P''(t)\)</span> and find that <span class="process-math">\(P''(t) = 2(1.37)^t \ln(1.37) \ln(1.37)\)</span> and therefore find that <span class="process-math">\(P''(4) \approx 0.69825\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(P''(4)\)</span> is positive, this tells us that the instantaneous rate of change <span class="process-math">\(P'(t)\)</span> is increasing at <span class="process-math">\(t = 4\text{,}\)</span> and thus the population is growing at an increasing rate.</p></li>
<li><p>Given <span class="process-math">\(p(a) = 3a^4 - 2a^3 + 7a^2 - a + 12\text{,}\)</span> first observe that <span class="process-math">\(p(-1) = 3 + 2 + 7 + 1 + 12 = 25\text{,}\)</span> so the tangent line will pass through <span class="process-math">\((-1,25)\text{.}\)</span> Further, since <span class="process-math">\(p'(a) = 12a^3 - 6a^2 + 14a - 1\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(p'(-1) = -12 - 6 - 14 - 1 = -33\text{,}\)</span> which is the slope of the tangent line. The equation of the tangent line is therefore <span class="process-math">\(y - 25 = -33(a+1)\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>The biggest difference is that (a) asks for the <em class="emphasis">slope</em> of the tangent line, while (c) asks for the <em class="emphasis">equation</em> of the tangent line. The latter requires the slope of the tangent line, but the slope and equation are two different entities.</p></li>
