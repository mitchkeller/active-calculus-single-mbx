<em class="alert">SOLUTION</em> Since the graph of <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> is a line, its average rate of change is the same over all intervals.  Since the graph of <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> is going up, its average rate of change is always positive.  The average rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is clearly changing depending on the interval.  If the slope of the line connecting the two endpoints of the interval on <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is going up and is steeper than the slope of <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\text{,}\)</span> then the average rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> will be greater over that interval.  If the line connecting the two endpoints points on <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is less steep, horizontal, or going down, then the average rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> will greater over that interval.  If the slope of the line  connecting to endpoints of the interval on <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> is the same as the slope of <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\text{,}\)</span> then the two average rates of change will be equal (such as the case for the interval <span class="process-math">\(2.2 \leq x \leq 6.1\text{.}\)</span>  Based on this consideration, you should determine the following answers: <div class="tabular-box natural-width"><table class="tabular">
<tr>
<td class="l m b2 r2 l2 t2 lines">Interval</td>
<td class="l m b2 r2 l0 t2 lines">Which function has GREATER average rate of change?</td>
