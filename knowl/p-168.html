<h5 class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>
<div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">We make the assumptions that <span class="process-math">\(-0.5 \lt  h \lt  0.5\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h \ne 0\)</span> because <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> cannot be zero (otherwise there is no interval on which to compute average velocity) and because the function only makes sense on the time interval <span class="process-math">\(0 \le t \le 1\text{,}\)</span> as this is the duration of time during which the ball is falling. We want to compute and simplify<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} = \frac{s(0.5+h) - s(0.5)}{(0.5+h) - 0.5}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>We start by finding <span class="process-math">\(s(0.5+h)\text{.}\)</span> To do so, we follow the rule that defines the function <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span><div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
s(0.5+h) \amp  =  16 - 16(0.5 + h)^2\\
\amp  =  16 - 16(0.25 + h + h^2)\\
\amp  =  16 - 4 - 16h - 16h^2\\
\amp  =  12 - 16h - 16h^2\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>Now, returning to our computation of the average velocity, we find that<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} \amp  =  \frac{s(0.5+h) - s(0.5)}{(0.5+h) - 0.5}\\
\amp  =  \frac{(12 - 16h - 16h^2) - (16 - 16(0.5)^2)}{0.5 + h - 0.5}\\
\amp  =  \frac{12 - 16h - 16h^2 - 12}{h}\\
\amp  =  \frac{-16h - 16h^2}{h}\text{.}
\end{align*}
</div>At this point, we note two things: first, the expression for average velocity clearly depends on <span class="process-math">\(h\text{,}\)</span> which it must, since as <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> changes the average velocity will change. Further, we note that since <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> can never equal zero, we may remove the common factor of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> from the numerator and denominator. It follows that<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]} = -16 - 16h\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">From this expression we can compute the average for any small positive or negative value of <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> For instance, to obtain the average velocity on <span class="process-math">\([0.5,0.75]\text{,}\)</span> we let <span class="process-math">\(h = 0.25\text{,}\)</span> and the average velocity is <span class="process-math">\(-16 - 16(0.25) = -20\)</span> ft/sec. To get the average velocity on <span class="process-math">\([0.4, 0.5]\text{,}\)</span> we let <span class="process-math">\(h = -0.1\text{,}\)</span> and compute the average velocity as<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
-16 - 16(-0.1) = -14.4\ \text{ft/sec}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We can even explore what happens to <span class="process-math">\(AV_{[0.5, 0.5+h]}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> gets closer and closer to zero. As <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> approaches zero, <span class="process-math">\(-16h\)</span> will also approach zero, so it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at <span class="process-math">\(t = 0.5\)</span> should be <span class="process-math">\(-16\)</span> ft/sec.</div></li>
