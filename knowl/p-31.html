<p>This book is intended to be read sequentially and engaged with, much more than to be used as a lookup reference.  For example, each section begins with a short introduction and a Preview Activity; you should read the short introduction and complete the Preview Activity prior to class.  Your instructor may require you to do this.  Most Preview Activities can be completed in 15-20 minutes and are intended to be accessible based on the understanding you have from preceding sections.  There are not answers provided to Preview Activities, as these are designed simply to get you thinking about ideas that will be helpful in work on upcoming new material.</p>
