<li><div class="para">We can't use <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution since there's not a function-derivative pair present (nor even a composite function). To show that integration by parts doesn't work is more complicated, but comes down to the fact that if we use the natural choice of <span class="process-math">\(u = x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv = \tan(x) \, dx\text{,}\)</span> to do so requires us to evaluate the integral <span class="process-math">\(\int \ln(\sec(x)) \, dx\text{,}\)</span> which appears not to have an elementary antiderivative. If we try instead <span class="process-math">\(u = \tan(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv = x \, dx\text{,}\)</span> then we have to evaluate the integral <span class="process-math">\(\int x^2 \cdot \sec^2(x) \, dx\)</span> which is more complicated than the integral we started with and would seem to send us back where we started if we attempt integration by parts.</div></li>

<div class="para">We use computational technology to generate the following estimates, which are reported to <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> decimal places of accuracy:</div>

Thus, <span class="process-math">\(L_4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M_4\)</span> are underestimates while <span class="process-math">\(R_4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M_4\)</span> are overestimates.</div></li>
