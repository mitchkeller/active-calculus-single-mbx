<div class="para">A recurring theme in our discussion of differential calculus has been the question “Given information about the derivative of an unknown function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> how much information can we obtain about <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> itself?” In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act-1-8-2.html" title="Activity 1.8.3">Activity 1.8.3</a>, the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = f'(x)\)</span> was known (along with the value of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> at a single point) and we endeavored to sketch a possible graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> near the known point. In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Ex-f-from-f-prime.html" title="Example 3.1.6">Example 3.1.6</a> — we investigated how the first derivative test enables us to use information about <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> to determine where the original function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is increasing and decreasing, as well as where <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has relative extreme values. If we know a formula or graph of <span class="process-math">\(f'\text{,}\)</span> by computing <span class="process-math">\(f''\)</span> we can find where the original function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is concave up and concave down. Thus, knowing <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f''\)</span> enables us to understand the shape of the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span>
