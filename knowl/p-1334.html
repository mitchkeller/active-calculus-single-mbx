<li><div class="para">At <span class="process-math">\(a = -1\text{,}\)</span> note that <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to -1} f(x)\)</span> exists (and appears to have value approximately <span class="process-math">\(-3.25\)</span>), but <span class="process-math">\(f(-1) = 1\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to -1} f(x) \ne f(-1)\text{.}\)</span> At <span class="process-math">\(a = 3\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to 3} f(x) = -2.5\text{,}\)</span> but <span class="process-math">\(f(3)\)</span> is not defined, so the limit exists but does not equal the function value.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Based on our work in (a), (b), and (c), <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not continuous at <span class="process-math">\(a=-2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(a = 2\)</span> because <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> does not have a limit at those points; <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not continuous at <span class="process-math">\(a = 3\)</span> since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not defined there; and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is not continuous at <span class="process-math">\(a = -1\)</span> because at that point its limit does not equal its function value.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">“If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> <em class="emphasis">is continuous</em> at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> <em class="emphasis">has a limit</em> at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span>” since one of the defining properties of “being continuous” at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\)</span> is that the function has a limit at that input value. This shows that being continuous is a stronger condition than having a limit.</div></li>
