<div class="para">Of the three conditions discussed in this section (having a limit at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> being continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> and being differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\)</span>), the strongest condition is being differentiable, and the next strongest is being continuous. In particular, if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is also continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> and if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a limit at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{.}\)</span>
