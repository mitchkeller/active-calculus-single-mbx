<div class="para">It makes sense intuitively that there must be at least one time at which the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned equals the average rate at which calories are burned, as it would be impossible for a continuous instantaneous rate of change to always be above its average value. Since we know from (c) that <span class="process-math">\(c_{\text{AVG} [0,40]} = \frac{85}{6}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(c(t)\)</span> tells us the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned, it follows that we want to solve the equation</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
c(t) = \frac{85}{6}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">From the graph, it appears that there are two such values of <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> for which this equation is true, one in the first ten minutes, and one in the last ten. For instance, solving</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
-0.05t^2 + t + 10 = \frac{85}{6}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">it follows that <span class="process-math">\(t = \frac{5}{3}(6 \pm \sqrt{6}) \approx 14.082, 5.918\text{,}\)</span> only the second of which lies in <span class="process-math">\(0 \le t \le 10\text{.}\)</span> So one time at which the instantaneous rate at which calories are burned equals the average rate on <span class="process-math">\([0,40]\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(t = \frac{5}{3}(6 - \sqrt{6}) \approx 5.918\text{.}\)</span> Similar reasoning leads to the second time that lies in <span class="process-math">\([30,40]\text{.}\)</span>
