<div class="para">The idea demonstrated in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/PA-2-8.html" title="Preview Activity 2.8.1">Preview Activity 2.8.1</a> — that we can evaluate an indeterminate limit of the form <span class="process-math">\(\frac{0}{0}\)</span> by replacing each of the numerator and denominator with their local linearizations at the point of interest — can be generalized in a way that enables us to evaluate a wide range of limits. We have a function <span class="process-math">\(h(x)\)</span> that can be written as a quotient <span class="process-math">\(h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> are both differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(x=a\)</span> and for which <span class="process-math">\(f(a) = g(a) = 0\text{.}\)</span> We would like to evaluate the indeterminate limit given by <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to a} h(x)\text{.}\)</span> <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-2-8-LHR.html" title="Figure 2.8.1">Figure 2.8.1</a> illustrates the situation. We see that both <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> have an <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-intercept at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{.}\)</span> Their respective tangent line approximations <span class="process-math">\(L_f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(L_g\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\)</span> are also shown in the figure. We can take advantage of the fact that a function and its tangent line approximation become indistinguishable as <span class="process-math">\(x \to a\text{.}\)</span>
