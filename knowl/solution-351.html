<li><p>We can't use <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution since there's not a function-derivative pair present (nor even a composite function). To show that integration by parts doesn't work is more complicated, but comes down to the fact that if we use the natural choice of <span class="process-math">\(u = x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv = \tan(x) \, dx\text{,}\)</span> to do so requires us to evaluate the integral <span class="process-math">\(\int \ln(\sec(x)) \, dx\text{,}\)</span> which appears not to have an elementary antiderivative. If we try instead <span class="process-math">\(u = \tan(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv = x \, dx\text{,}\)</span> then we have to evaluate the integral <span class="process-math">\(\int x^2 \cdot \sec^2(x) \, dx\)</span> which is more complicated than the integral we started with and would seem to send us back where we started if we attempt integration by parts.</p></li>
<li>
<p>We use computational technology to generate the following estimates, which are reported to <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> decimal places of accuracy:</p>
<ul class="disc">
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle L_4 = 0.25892\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle R_4 = 0.64827\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle M_4 = 0.41550\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle T_4 = \frac{L_4 + R_4}{2} = 0.45360\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="process-math">\(\displaystyle S_8 = \frac{2M_4 + T_4}{3} = 0.42820\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>From the values of these estimates or from the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = x\tan(x)\text{,}\)</span> we can observe that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is always increasing and concave up on the interval. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(L_4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M_4\)</span> are underestimates while <span class="process-math">\(R_4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M_4\)</span> are overestimates.</p></li>
