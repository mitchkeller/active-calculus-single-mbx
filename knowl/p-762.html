<p>It is a powerful feature of mathematics that it can be studied both as abstract discipline and as an applied one. For instance, calculus can be developed almost entirely as an abstract collection of ideas that focus on properties of functions. At the same time, if we consider functions that represent meaningful processes, calculus can describe our experience of physical reality. We have already seen that for the position function <span class="process-math">\(y = s(t)\)</span> of a ball being tossed straight up in the air, the derivative of the position function, <span class="process-math">\(v(t) = s'(t)\text{,}\)</span> gives the ball's velocity at time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span></p>
