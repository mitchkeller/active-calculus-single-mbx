<div class="para">Given a composite function <span class="process-math">\(C(x) = f(g(x))\)</span> that is built from differentiable functions <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> how do we compute <span class="process-math">\(C'(x)\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f'\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g'\text{?}\)</span> In the same way that the rate of change of a product of two functions, <span class="process-math">\(p(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)\text{,}\)</span> depends on the behavior of both <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\text{,}\)</span> it makes sense intuitively that the rate of change of a composite function <span class="process-math">\(C(x) = f(g(x))\)</span> will also depend on some combination of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> and their derivatives. The rule that describes how to compute <span class="process-math">\(C'\)</span> in terms of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> and their derivatives is called the <em class="emphasis">chain rule</em>.</div>
