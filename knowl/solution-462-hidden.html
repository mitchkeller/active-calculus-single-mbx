<li><p>A continuous function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a limit <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as the independent variable <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> goes to infinity if we can make the values of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as close to <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as we want by choosing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as large as we need.</p></li>
<li><p>We expect that a sequence <span class="process-math">\(\{s_n\}\)</span> will have a limit <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> goes to infinity if we can make the entries <span class="process-math">\(s_n\)</span> in the sequence as close to <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as we want by choosing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> as large as we need.</p></li>
<li><p>As <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> gets large, the constant terms become infinitesimally small compared to <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> and so <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1+n}{2+n}\)</span> looks like <span class="process-math">\(\frac{n}{n}\)</span> or 1 for large <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span> So the sequence <span class="process-math">\(\left\{ \frac{1+n}{2+n}\right\}\)</span> has a limit of 1 at infinity.</p></li>
