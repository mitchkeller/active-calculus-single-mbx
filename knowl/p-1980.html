<div class="para logical"><ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><div class="para">January 1, 2012 corresponds to the instant <span class="process-math">\(t = 2\text{,}\)</span> so we compute <span class="process-math">\(V'(2)\text{.}\)</span> First, we observe by the sum and constant multiple rules that <span class="process-math">\(V'(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t \cdot \ln(1.07) + 6 \cos(t)\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(V'(2) = 24 \cdot 1.07^2 \cdot \ln(1.07) + 6 \cos(2) \approx -0.63778\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> is measured in thousands of dollars and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in years, we know that the portfolio's value is decreasing at a rate of <span class="process-math">\(637.78\)</span> dollars per year on January 1, 2012.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(V'(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t \cdot \ln(1.07) + 6 \cos(t)\text{,}\)</span> it follows that <span class="process-math">\(V''(t) = 24 \cdot 1.07^t \cdot (\ln(1.07))^2 - 6 \sin(t)\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(V''(2) = 24 \cdot 1.07^2 \cdot \ln(1.07)^2 - 6 \sin(2) \approx -5.33\text{,}\)</span> with units ``thousands of dollars per year per year.'' This means that at the moment <span class="process-math">\(t = 2\text{,}\)</span> the portfolio's value is decreasing at a decreasing rate. More specifically, we know that <span class="process-math">\(V'\)</span> is decreasing at the moment <span class="process-math">\(t = 2\)</span> and expect the derivative's value to decrease by about <span class="process-math">\(5.33\)</span> thousand dollars per year over the course of the next year. In other words, the portfolio's value is not only decreasing, but we expect it to decrease more rapidly as the year goes on.</div></li>

<div class="para">In the figure below, we see plots of both <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> along with their corresponding derivatives. We see that the function <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is a purely exponential function that always increases at an increasing rate. By adding the term <span class="process-math">\(6\sin(t)\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> to create the function <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> we add volatility to the value of the portfolio: the oscillating nature of the sine function not only creates variance in the stock's value, but also in its rate of change. We also observe that as time progresses and the value of <span class="process-math">\(24 \cdot (1.07)^t\)</span> increases, the effect of <span class="process-math">\(6 \sin(t)\)</span> lessens.</div>
