<li><p>There are <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> equally possible outcomes when we roll one die, and only one of those is a <span class="process-math">\(6\text{,}\)</span> so the probability that a <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> appears when we roll the die is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{6}\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>On the first roll, the probability of not rolling a <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{5}{6}\text{.}\)</span> This is the same on the second roll, so the probability of not rolling a <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> on either of the first two rolls is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{5}{6}\text{,}\)</span> since the two events are independent. If we then roll a <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> on the following turn, the probability of doing so in that roll is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{6}\text{,}\)</span> so with the three rolls being independent, the probability of you rolling a <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> on your second turn (the third overall roll) is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
P = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)\text{.}

<li>
<p>The exact same reasoning as in (b), but with <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> dice rolls instead of <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> shows that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
P = \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{5}{6} \right) \left( \frac{1}{6} \right)\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>By simply summing the probabilities to consider all of the possible outcomes (rolling <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> on your first turn, doing so on your second, etc.), we get that the total probability of you rolling a <span class="process-math">\(6\)</span> on one of your turns is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{1}{6} + \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) +  \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^4\left(\frac{1}{6}\right) + \cdots\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which is a geometric series with <span class="process-math">\(a = \frac{1}{6}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(r = \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^2\text{.}\)</span> Since we know that a geometric series has sum <span class="process-math">\(S = \frac{a}{1-r}\text{,}\)</span> it follows that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
P = \frac{\frac{1}{6}}{1 - \frac{25}{36}} = \frac{\frac{6}{36}}{\frac{11}{36}} = \frac{6}{11}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">so by going first your odds are just slightly better than half that you'll be the first one to roll a <span class="process-math">\(6\text{.}\)</span></p>
