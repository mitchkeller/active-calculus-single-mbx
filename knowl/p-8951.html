<p>Suppose you want to buy a house. You have a certain amount of money saved to make a down payment, and you will borrow the rest to pay for the house. Of course, for the privilege of loaning you the money, the bank will charge you interest on this loan, so the amount you pay back to the bank is more than the amount you borrow. In fact, the amount you ultimately pay depends on three things: the amount you borrow (called the <em class="emphasis">principal</em>), the interest rate, and the length of time you have to pay off the loan plus interest (called the <em class="emphasis">duration</em> of the loan). For this example, we assume that the interest rate is fixed at <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span>%.</p>
