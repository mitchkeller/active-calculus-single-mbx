<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">
<p>We begin by letting <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> be the distance from <span class="process-math">\(Z\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{.}\)</span> Since it is 3 km from <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(Q\text{,}\)</span> the distance from <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(Z\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(3-x\text{.}\)</span> Further, by the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance from <span class="process-math">\(Z\)</span> to the cabin is <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{4+x^2}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Next, we want to determine the hiker's time as a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Because distance equals rate times time, time is thus distance divided by rate. Along the road, the hiker's distance is <span class="process-math">\(3-x\)</span> km and her rate is <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> km/hr, thus her time on the road, <span class="process-math">\(T_r\)</span> is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
T_r = \frac{3-x}{8}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Once she enters the woods, her rate drops to <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> km/hr and travels a distance of <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{4+x^2}\)</span> km, making her time in the woods, <span class="process-math">\(T_w\text{,}\)</span> given by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
T_w = \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Thus, the hiker's total time is given by the function</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
T(x) = \frac{3-x}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{4+x^2}}{3}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Because the only values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> that make sense to use are <span class="process-math">\(0 \le x \le 3\)</span> (using either negative values or values greater than 3 clearly add unnecessary time to the trip), we use this domain for <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> and now seek the absolute minimum of <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\([0,3]\text{.}\)</span> First, we find that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
T'(x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} (4+x^2)^{-1/2} (2x) = -\frac{1}{8} + \frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Setting <span class="process-math">\(T'(x) = 0\)</span> and solving for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(\frac{x}{3\sqrt{4+x^2}} = \frac{1}{8}\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(8x = 3\sqrt{4+x^2}\text{.}\)</span> Squaring both sides, <span class="process-math">\(64x^2 = 9(4+x^2) = 36 + 9x^2\text{.}\)</span> Hence, <span class="process-math">\(55x^2 = 36\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(x = \sqrt{\frac{36}{55}} \approx 0.80904\text{.}\)</span> (We don't consider the critical number <span class="process-math">\(x = -\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}\)</span> because this doesn't lie in the relevant domain of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span>)</p>
<p>Finally, we evaluate <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> at the only critical number in the interval and at the interval's endpoints. Doing so, we find <span class="process-math">\(T(0) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{2}{3} \approx 1.0417\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(T(3) = \frac{\sqrt{13}}{3} \approx 1.20185\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(T(\sqrt{\frac{36}{55}}) = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{\sqrt{55}}{12} \approx 0.99302\text{,}\)</span> and thus the absolute minimum time the hiker can achieve is <span class="process-math">\(0.99302\)</span> hours, which is attained by hiking about 2.2 km from <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(Q\)</span> and then turning into the woods for the remainder of the trip.</p>
