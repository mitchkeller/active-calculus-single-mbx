<p>A cylindrical tank, buried on its side, has radius <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> feet and length <span class="process-math">\(10\)</span> feet. It is filled completely with water whose weight density is <span class="process-math">\(62.4\)</span> lbs/ft<span class="process-math">\(^3\text{,}\)</span> and the top of the tank is two feet underground.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Set up, but do not evaluate, an integral expression that represents the amount of work required to empty the top half of the water in the tank to a truck whose tank lies 4.5 feet above ground.</p></li>
<li><p>With the tank now only half-full, set up, but do not evaluate an integral expression that represents the total force due to hydrostatic pressure against one end of the tank.</p></li>
