<div class="para logical"><ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">A function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has limit <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x \to a\)</span> if and only if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a left-hand limit at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a right-hand limit at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> and the left- and right-hand limits are equal. Visually, this means that there can be a hole in the graph at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> but the function must approach the same single value from either side of <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(f(a)\)</span> is defined, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a limit as <span class="process-math">\(x \to a\text{,}\)</span> and the value of the limit and the value of the function agree. This guarantees that there is not a hole or jump in the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">A function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\)</span> whenever <span class="process-math">\(f'(a)\)</span> exists, which means that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a tangent line at <span class="process-math">\((a,f(a))\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is locally linear at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{.}\)</span> Informally, this means that the function looks like a line when viewed up close at <span class="process-math">\((a,f(a))\)</span> and that there is not a corner point or cusp at <span class="process-math">\((a,f(a))\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Of the three conditions discussed in this section (having a limit at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> being continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> and being differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\)</span>), the strongest condition is being differentiable, and the next strongest is being continuous. In particular, if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is also continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> and if <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a limit at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{.}\)</span>
