<em class="alert">A.</em> Euler's method with two steps uses <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x = 0.5\text{,}\)</span> so we have <span class="process-math">\(y(0) = 4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y(0.5) \approx y(0) + 0.5 ( 7 (0) ) = 4\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y(1) \approx y(0.5) + 0.5 ( 7 (0.5) ) = 4 + 1.75 = 5.75\text{.}\)</span> Similarly, with four steps <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x = 0.25\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(y(0) = 4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y(0.25) \approx y(0) + 0.25 ( 7 (0) ) = 4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y(0.5) \approx y(0.25) + 0.25 (7 (0.25)) = 4.4375\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y(0.75) \approx y(0.5) + 0.25 (7 (0.5)) = 5.3125\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(y(1) \approx y(0.75) + 0.25 (7 (0.75)) = 6.625\text{,}\)</span> <em class="alert">B.</em> We can just integrate to find the solution to the differential equation: <span class="process-math">\(y = \frac{7}{2} x^2 + C\text{.}\)</span>  For <span class="process-math">\(y(0) = 4\text{,}\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(y = \frac{7}{2} x^2 + 4\text{.}\)</span> <em class="alert">C.</em> The error in the two Euler approximations is just the difference between the estimates for <span class="process-math">\(y(1)\)</span> and the exact value.  That is, the difference between 5.75 and 7.5, and between 6.625 and 7.5.  Thus, taking the magnitude of the differences, Error in Euler with two steps = 1.75, and Error in Euler with four steps = 0.875. <em class="alert">D.</em> Since we doubled the number of steps we took, we expect the error to drop by a factor of two (that is, the error in the Euler approximation with two steps should be twice as big as that with four), which it is.</div>
