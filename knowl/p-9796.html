<div class="para">The behaviors of both cups of coffee are similar in that each decreases toward the room temperature initially and then is driven in an osciallating way by the room temperature function as it rises and falls. We see that Alice’s coffee is more susceptible to being influenced away from the average room temperature, which is consistent with her mug being less well insulated, while in Bob’s coffee, we see much less radical oscillations (and a slower overall rate of decrease to get near room temperature), which is consistent with being better insulated.</div>
