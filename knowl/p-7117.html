<p>The preceding example demonstrates the standard approach to finding the work required to empty a tank filled with liquid. The main task in each such problem is to determine the volume of a representative slice, followed by the force exerted on the slice, as well as the distance such a slice moves. In the case where the units are metric, there is one key difference: in the metric setting, rather than weight, we normally first find the mass of a slice. For instance, if distance is measured in meters, the mass density of water is 1000 kg/m<span class="process-math">\(^3\text{.}\)</span> In that setting, we can find the mass of a typical slice (in kg). To determine the force required to move it, we use <span class="process-math">\(F = ma\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> is the object's mass and <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is the gravitational constant <span class="process-math">\(a=9.81\)</span> N/kg. That is, in metric units, the weight density of water is 9810 N/m<span class="process-math">\(^3\text{.}\)</span></p>
