<div class="para">For integration by parts to work, we normally need a choice of <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> that is straightforward to differentiate, and <span class="process-math">\(dv\)</span> that is straightforward to antidifferentiate. Noting that the integrand can really only be written as the product of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{x}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\sqrt{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}\text{,}\)</span> it appears that the most natural possible option is to let <span class="process-math">\(u = \sqrt{x+\sqrt{1+x^2}}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(dv = \frac{1}{x} \, dx\text{,}\)</span> since we can antidifferentiate <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{x}\text{.}\)</span> Here, however, the approach stalls, because integration by parts requires us to evaluate <span class="process-math">\(\int v \, du\text{,}\)</span> and that integral is</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\int \ln|x| \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left( x + \sqrt{1+x^2} \right)^{-1/2} \cdot \left( 1 + x(1+x^2)^{-1/2} \right) \, dx

<div class="para">which is far more complicated than the already-complicated integral we started with. From this it appears that integration by parts will not be productive.</div>
