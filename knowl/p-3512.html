<p>We note that <span class="process-math">\(h'\)</span> is increasing everywhere, <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is concave up everywhere. Since the graph of <span class="process-math">\(h'\)</span> levels off for large values of <span class="process-math">\(|x|\text{,}\)</span> the concavity of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is small when <span class="process-math">\(|x|\)</span> is large. Also, the largest value of the slope of the tangent line to <span class="process-math">\(h'\)</span> occurs when <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> has its largest second dervitive when <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is almost linear as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> decreases without bound, <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> has more bend as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> has its greatest bend at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{,}\)</span> then the second derivative of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases, ultimately having <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> become almost linear as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases without bound.</p>
