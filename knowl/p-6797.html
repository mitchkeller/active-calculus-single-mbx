<p>Consider the curves given by <span class="process-math">\(y = \sin(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y = \cos(x)\text{.}\)</span> For each of the following problems, you should include a sketch of the region/solid being considered, as well as a labeled representative slice.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Sketch the region <span class="process-math">\(R\)</span> bounded by the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis and the curves <span class="process-math">\(y = \sin(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y = \cos(x)\)</span> up to the first positive value of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> at which they intersect. What is the exact intersection point of the curves?</p></li>
