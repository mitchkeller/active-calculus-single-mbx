<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(h(x) = a - ae^{-bx}\text{,}\)</span> we have by the constant multiple and chain rules that</p>

\begin{equation*}

</div>
<p class="continuation">Since <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> are positive constants and <span class="process-math">\(e^{-bx} \gt 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> we see that <span class="process-math">\(h'(x)\)</span> is never zero (nor undefined), and indeed <span class="process-math">\(h'(x) \gt 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is an always increasing function.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Because <span class="process-math">\(h'(x) = abe^{-bx}\text{,}\)</span> we have that <span class="process-math">\(h''(x) = abe^{-bx}(-b) = -ab^2e^{-bx}\text{.}\)</span> As with <span class="process-math">\(h'\text{,}\)</span> we recognize that <span class="process-math">\(a\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(b^2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e^{-bx}\)</span> are always positive, and thus <span class="process-math">\(h''(x) = -ab^2e^{-bx} \lt 0\)</span> for all values of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> making <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> always concave down.</p></li>
<li>
<p>As <span class="process-math">\(x \to \infty\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(e^{-bx} \to 0\text{.}\)</span> Thus,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} a(1-e^{-bx}) = \lim_{x \to \infty} a - ae^{-bx} = a - 0 = a\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">This shows that <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> has a horizontal asymptote at <span class="process-math">\(y = a\)</span> as we move rightward on its graph. As <span class="process-math">\(x \to -\infty\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(e^{-bx} \to \infty\text{.}\)</span> Thus,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{x \to \infty} a(1-e^{-bx}) = \lim_{x \to \infty} a - ae^{-bx} = -\infty\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Noting that <span class="process-math">\(h'(x) = abe^{-bx}\text{,}\)</span> we see that if we consider different values of <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> the slope of the graph changes. If <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is large and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is close to zero, <span class="process-math">\(h'(x) \approx ab\)</span> (since <span class="process-math">\(e^0 = 1\)</span>), so <span class="process-math">\(h'(x)\)</span> is relatively large near <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{.}\)</span> At the same time, for large <span class="process-math">\(b\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(e^{-bx}\)</span> approaches zero quickly as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases, so the curve's slope will quickly approach zero as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases. If <span class="process-math">\(b\)</span> is small, the graph is less steep near <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\)</span> and its slope goes to zero less quickly as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases.</p></li>
<li>
<p>Observing that <span class="process-math">\(h(0) = 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to \infty} h(x) = a\text{,}\)</span> along with the facts that <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is always increasing and always concave down, we see that a typical member of this family looks like the following graph.</p>
