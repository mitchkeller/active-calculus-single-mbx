<li><div class="para">To find algebraic formulas for antiderivatives of more complicated algebraic functions, we need to think carefully about how we can reverse known differentiation rules. To that end, it is essential that we understand and recall known derivatives of basic functions, as well as the standard derivative rules.</div></li>
<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The indefinite integral provides notation for antiderivatives. When we write “<span class="process-math">\(\int f(x) \, dx\text{,}\)</span>” we mean “the general antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span>”  In particular, if we have functions <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(F' = f\text{,}\)</span> the following two statements say the exact thing:</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{d}{dx}[F(x)] = f(x) \ \text{and}  \ \int f(x) \, dx = F(x) + C\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">That is, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(F\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span>
</div>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">The technique of <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span>-substitution helps us to evaluate indefinite integrals of the form <span class="process-math">\(\int f(g(x))g'(x) \, dx\)</span> through the substitutions <span class="process-math">\(u = g(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(du = g'(x) \, dx\text{,}\)</span> so that</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\int f(g(x))g'(x) \, dx = \int f(u) \, du\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">A key part of choosing the expression in <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> to be represented by <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> is the identification of a function-derivative pair. To do so, we often look for an “inner” function <span class="process-math">\(g(x)\)</span> that is part of a composite function, while investigating whether <span class="process-math">\(g'(x)\)</span> (or a constant multiple of <span class="process-math">\(g'(x)\)</span>) is present as a multiplying factor of the integrand.</div>
