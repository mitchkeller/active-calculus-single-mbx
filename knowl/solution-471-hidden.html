<p>Sampling the function at the endpoints of <span class="process-math">\(8\)</span> equal subintervals of length <span class="process-math">\(10/8 = 1.25\text{,}\)</span> we see the data pictured in the following figure (with the sample points in red). While the function is periodic with a period of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{2\pi}{4} = \frac{\pi}{2}\text{,}\)</span> the <span class="process-math">\(9\)</span> data points do not appear periodic at all as none of them has repeated (yet) over the course of the pictured interval.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Since the period of the function <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \sin(4x)\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(P = \frac{\pi}{2}\text{,}\)</span> its frequency is <span class="process-math">\(\frac{2}{\pi} \approx 0.6366\text{,}\)</span> which means that this function completes about <span class="process-math">\(0.6366\)</span> cycles per second. Doubling this frequncy gives us a value of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{4}{\pi} \approx 1.2732\text{.}\)</span> This means that we should sample the function at at least a rate of twice per cycle, or at least <span class="process-math">\(1.2732\)</span> samples per second. On a 10-second interval, we therefore need at least <span class="process-math">\(13\)</span> samples, so we should do so at least every <span class="process-math">\(10/13 \approx 0.76923\)</span> seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the theorem says to sample at a minimum of double the maximum desired frequency, and humans can't detect signals above <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> KHz, it follows that double <span class="process-math">\(20\)</span> KHz is <span class="process-math">\(40\)</span> KHz, or <span class="process-math">\(40000\)</span> Hz, so sampling at <span class="process-math">\(44100\)</span> Hz slightly exceeds the minimum sampling needed by the formal result.</p></li>
