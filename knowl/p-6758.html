<ul class="disc">
<li><p>We can use a definite integral to find the volume of a three-dimensional solid of revolution that results from revolving a two-dimensional region about a particular axis by taking slices perpendicular to the axis of revolution which will then be circular disks or washers.</p></li>
<li><p>If we revolve about a vertical line and slice perpendicular to that line, then our slices are horizontal and of thickness <span class="process-math">\(\Delta y\text{.}\)</span> This leads us to integrate with respect to <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> as opposed to with respect to <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> when we slice a solid vertically.</p></li>
<li><p>If we revolve about a line other than the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>- or <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-axis, we need to carefully account for the shift that occurs in the radius of a typical slice. Normally, this shift involves taking a sum or difference of the function along with the constant connected to the equation for the horizontal or vertical line; a well-labeled diagram is usually the best way to decide the new expression for the radius.</p></li>
