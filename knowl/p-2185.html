<p>Say that an investor is regularly purchasing stock in a particular company. Let <span class="process-math">\(N(t)\)</span> represent the number of shares owned on day <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(t = 0\)</span> represents the first day on which shares were purchased. Let <span class="process-math">\(S(t)\)</span> give the value of one share of the stock on day <span class="process-math">\(t\text{;}\)</span> note that the units on <span class="process-math">\(S(t)\)</span> are dollars per share. To compute the total value of the stock on day <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> we take the product</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V(t) = N(t) \, \text{shares}  \cdot S(t) \, \text{dollars per share}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Observe that over time, both the number of shares and the value of a given share will vary. The derivative <span class="process-math">\(N'(t)\)</span> measures the rate at which the number of shares is changing, while <span class="process-math">\(S'(t)\)</span> measures the rate at which the value per share is changing. How do these respective rates of change affect the rate of change of the total value function?</p>
