<div class="para">Here, we first observe that we are working on the domain of all real numbers, not a closed bounded interval. Hence, we need to think about the overall behavior of the function. First, since <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = 4 - e^{-(x-2)^2}\text{,}\)</span> by the chain rule we see that <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) = -e^{-(x-2)^2}(-2(x-2)) = 2(x-2)e^{-(x-2)^2}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(e^{-(x-2)^2}\)</span> is always positive (in particular, never zero), it follows that the only critical number of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(x = 2\text{.}\)</span> Furthermore, with <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) = 2(x-2)e^{-(x-2)^2}\text{,}\)</span> we see that for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt 2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) \lt 0\text{,}\)</span> while for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> This tells us by the first derivative test that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is decreasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt 2\)</span> and increasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 2\text{,}\)</span> which tells us that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has an absolute minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x = 2\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> does not have an absolute maximum.</div>
