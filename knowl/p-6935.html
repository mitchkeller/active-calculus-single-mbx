<p>Consider a thin bar of length 20 cm whose density is distributed according to the function <span class="process-math">\(\rho(x) = 4 + 0.1x\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\)</span> represents the left end of the bar. Assume that <span class="process-math">\(\rho\)</span> is measured in g/cm and <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is measured in cm.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Find the total mass, <span class="process-math">\(M\text{,}\)</span> of the bar.</p></li>
<li><p>Without doing any calculations, do you expect the center of mass of the bar to be equal to 10, less than 10, or greater than 10? Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Compute <span class="process-math">\(\overline{x}\text{,}\)</span> the exact center of mass of the bar.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the average density of the bar?</p></li>
<li><p>Now consider a different density function, given by <span class="process-math">\(p(x) = 4e^{0.020732x}\text{,}\)</span> also for a bar of length 20 cm whose left end is at <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{.}\)</span> Plot both <span class="process-math">\(\rho(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(p(x)\)</span> on the same axes. Without doing any calculations, which bar do you expect to have the greater center of mass? Why?</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the exact center of mass of the bar described in (e) whose density function is <span class="process-math">\(p(x) = 4e^{0.020732x}\text{.}\)</span> Check the result against the prediction you made in (e).</p></li>
