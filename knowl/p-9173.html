<div class="para">In this chapter, we introduce the concept of <em class="emphasis">differential equations</em>. A differential equation is an equation that provides a description of a function’s derivative, which means that it tells us the function’s rate of change. Using this information, we would like to learn as much as possible about the function itself. Ideally we would like to have an algebraic description of the function. As we’ll see, this may be too much to ask in some situations, but we will still be able to make accurate approximations.</div>
