<li><div class="para">For a definite integral such as <span class="process-math">\(\int_0^1 e^{-x^2} \, dx\)</span> when we cannot use the First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus because the integrand lacks an elementary algebraic antiderivative, we can estimate the integral's value by using a sequence of Riemann sum approximations. Typically, we start by computing <span class="process-math">\(L_n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(R_n\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M_n\)</span> for one or more chosen values of <span class="process-math">\(n\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The Trapezoid Rule, which estimates <span class="process-math">\(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\)</span> by using trapezoids, rather than rectangles, can also be viewed as the average of Left and Right Riemann sums. That is, <span class="process-math">\(T_n = \frac{1}{2}(L_n + R_n)\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The Midpoint Rule is typically twice as accurate as the Trapezoid Rule, and the signs of the respective errors of these rules are opposites. Hence, by taking the weighted average <span class="process-math">\(S_{2n} = \frac{2M_n + T_n}{3}\text{,}\)</span> we can build a much more accurate approximation to <span class="process-math">\(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\)</span> by using approximations we have already computed. The rule for <span class="process-math">\(S_{2n}\)</span> is known as Simpson's Rule, which can also be developed by approximating a given continuous function with pieces of quadratic polynomials.</div></li>
