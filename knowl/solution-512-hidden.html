<em class="alert">(a)</em> We know that a logistic curve can be modeled by the function<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
P=\frac{L}{1+Ce^{-kt}}
\end{equation*}
</div>where <span class="process-math">\(C=(L-P_0)/P_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is the number of people infected by the virus at a particular time <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> We know that <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> is the limiting value, or the maximal number of people infected with the virus, so in our case<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
L=6000.
\end{equation*}
</div>We are also told that initially there are only 25 people infected with the virus so that we get <span class="process-math">\(P_0=25.\)</span> Thus we have<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
C = \frac{L-P_0}{P_0} = \frac{6000-25}{25} = 239.
\end{equation*}
</div>We are also told that in the early stages of the virus, infection grows exponentially with <span class="process-math">\(k=1.9\text{.}\)</span> Thus we get that the logistic function for people infected is<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
P=\frac{6000}{1+239 e^{-1.9 t}}.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<em class="alert">(b)</em> Graphing this solution, we see <div class="image-box" style="width: 41%; margin-left: 29.5%; margin-right: 29.5%;"><img src="generated/webwork/images/webwork-352-image-1.png" class="contained"></div> Looking at the graph we see that the the point at which the rate changes from increasing to decreasing, the inflection point, occurs at roughly <span class="process-math">\(t=3\)</span> giving a value of <span class="process-math">\(P=3125\text{.}\)</span> Thus after roughly 3125 people have been infected, the rate of infection starts dropping.</div></body>
