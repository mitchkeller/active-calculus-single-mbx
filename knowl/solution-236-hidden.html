<p>The variables in this problem are the volume <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> of water in the pool and the depth <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span> of water in the pool (measured at the deepest point of the pool); each is implicitly a function of time, <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> We are given that <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dV}{dt}\)</span> is a constant <span class="process-math">\(800\)</span> cubic feet per minute and want to find <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dh}{dt}\bigm|_{h=5}\text{.}\)</span> To do this, we first need to relate <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> The volume of the water in the pool at height <span class="process-math">\(h \lt 12\)</span> is the volume of the triangular cross sectional area of height <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> (as shown in the figure below) times the width (25 feet) of the pool. The height of the triangular cross section is <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> and the length is distance of the dotted line indicated in the figure.</p>
<div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:17.5%;margin-right:17.5%;"><div class="sbspanel top" style="width:100%;"><img src="external/images/3_5_Ez2Soln.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div></div></div>
<p>Placing the cross section on a coordinate system as in the figure, the hypotenuse of the triangle is the line connecting the points <span class="process-math">\((0,-15)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((60, -3)\text{.}\)</span> This line has slope <span class="process-math">\(\frac{12}{60} = 0.2\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-intercept <span class="process-math">\((0,-15)\text{.}\)</span> So the equation of this line is <span class="process-math">\(y = 0.2x-15\text{.}\)</span> It is the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> coordinate of the point on this line corresponding to the <span class="process-math">\(y\)</span>-coordinate <span class="process-math">\(h-15\)</span> that is the length of the triangle whose height is <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> So the length <span class="process-math">\(l\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(l = \frac{(h-15)+15}{0.2} = 5h\text{.}\)</span> Thus, the volume of water in the pool at height <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V = \left(\frac{1}{2}(h)(5h)\right)(25) = 62.5h^2\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Both <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> are functions of time. Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to  <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> gives</p>

\begin{equation*}
\frac{dV}{dt} = 62.5(2h) \frac{dh}{dt}\text{,}

<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\frac{dh}{dt} = \frac{1}{125h} \frac{dV}{dt}\text{.}

<p class="continuation">When the depth of water in the pool is <span class="process-math">\(5\)</span> feet, then the depth is increasing at the rate</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\left. \frac{dh}{dt}\right|_{h = 5} = \frac{1}{125(5)} (800) = 1.28

</div>
<p class="continuation">feet per minute. Since <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dh}{dt}\)</span> is inversely proportional to <span class="process-math">\(h\text{,}\)</span> the rate at which the depth of the water increases slows as <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> increases, so the depth of the water is increasing at a decreasing rate.</p>
