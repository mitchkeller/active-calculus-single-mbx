<div class="para">A leaky bucket is being hauled up from a 100 foot deep well. When lifted from the water, the bucket and water together weigh 40 pounds. As the bucket is being hauled upward at a constant rate, the bucket leaks water at a constant rate so that it is losing weight at a rate of 0.1 pounds per foot. What function <span class="process-math">\(B(h)\)</span> tells the weight of the bucket after the bucket has been lifted <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> feet? What is the total amount of work accomplished in lifting the bucket to the top of the well?</div>
