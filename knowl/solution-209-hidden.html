<li><div class="para">As we noted in (a), <span class="process-math">\(x = m\)</span> is the only critical number of <span class="process-math">\(E\text{.}\)</span> More over, since <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> to any power is always positive, the sign of <span class="process-math">\(E'(x)\)</span> depends entirely on the expression <span class="process-math">\(-\frac{2(x-m)}{2s^2} = -\frac{1}{2}(x-m)\text{.}\)</span> This linear function of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> has negative slope, and thus is positive for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt m\)</span> and negative for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt m\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(E'(x)\)</span> is positive for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt m\)</span> and negative for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt m\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is increasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt m\)</span> and decreasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt m\text{,}\)</span> with a local maximum at <span class="process-math">\(x = m\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">From the given formula for <span class="process-math">\(E''(x)\)</span> and our knowledge that <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> to any power is positive, the only way <span class="process-math">\(E''(x) = 0\)</span> is for</div>

Thus, the power to which we are raising <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> in the formula for <span class="process-math">\(E(x)\)</span> is decreasing without bound, which means that <span class="process-math">\(E(x)\)</span> must approach <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> since raising <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> to more and more negative numbers drives the result to <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to \infty} E(x) = \lim_{x \to -\infty} E(x) = 0\text{.}\)</span>

<div class="para">We've shown that <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> has a single critical number at <span class="process-math">\(x = m\)</span> and two potential points of inflection at <span class="process-math">\(x = m \pm s\text{,}\)</span> as well as that <span class="process-math">\(E(x) \to 0\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x \to \pm \infty\text{.}\)</span> All of these properties are reflected in the following figure.</div>
