<div class="para">Because differential calculus is based on the definition of the derivative, and the definition of the derivative involves a limit, there is a sense in which all of calculus rests on limits. In addition, the limit involved in the definition of the derivative always generates the indeterminate form <span class="process-math">\(\frac{0}{0}\text{.}\)</span> If <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a differentiable function, then in the definition</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">not only does <span class="process-math">\(h \to 0\)</span> in the denominator, but also <span class="process-math">\((f(x+h)-f(x)) \to 0\)</span> in the numerator, since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous. Remember, saying that a limit has an indeterminate form only means that we donâ€™t yet know its value and have more work to do: indeed, limits of the form <span class="process-math">\(\frac{0}{0}\)</span> can take on any value, as is evidenced by evaluating <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> for varying values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for a function such as <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) = x^2\text{.}\)</span>
