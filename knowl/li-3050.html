<p>To find where <span class="process-math">\(a(t)\)</span> is greatest, we recall that <span class="process-math">\(a(t) = v'(t)\text{,}\)</span> so we are seeking the location where the slope of the tangent line to <span class="process-math">\(v(t)\)</span> is maximized on the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,24]\text{.}\)</span> From the graph, there are only two possible intervals where this can occur: <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt t \lt 4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(12 \lt t \lt 16\text{,}\)</span> as these are both where <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is increasing and thus <span class="process-math">\(a(t) = v'(t)\)</span> is positive.</p>
<p>On <span class="process-math">\(12 \lt t \lt 16\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a(t) = v'(t) = \frac{3}{2}\)</span> since this is the slope of the line that forms <span class="process-math">\(v(t)\)</span> on this interval. On <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt t \lt 4\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(v(t) = -\frac{1}{4}t^3 + \frac{3}{2}t^2 + 1\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(a(t) = v'(t) = -\frac{3}{4}t^2 + 3t\text{.}\)</span> We see that <span class="process-math">\(a(t)\)</span> is a quadratic function that opens down, so its maximum occurs at its vertex, which is located where <span class="process-math">\(a'(t) = 0\text{.}\)</span> We know that <span class="process-math">\(a'(t) = -\frac{3}{2}t + 3\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(0 = -\frac{3}{2}t + 3\)</span> implies <span class="process-math">\(t = 2\text{.}\)</span> Moreover, <span class="process-math">\(a(2) = v'(2) = -\frac{3}{4} \cdot 2^2 + 3(2) = 3\text{.}\)</span> Clearly <span class="process-math">\(a(2) = 3 \gt \frac{3}{2}\text{,}\)</span> so the object's maximum acceleration is <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> meters per minute per minute at the instant <span class="process-math">\(t = 2\text{.}\)</span></p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-4-4-FTC.html#egf" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
