<p>When a function is decreasing, its graph falls as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases, and when a function is concave up, that means the graph of the function looks bowl-shaped. A graph of a decreasing, concave up function <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> on the interval <span class="process-math">\((-3,-1)\)</span>is shown in the figure below. To be neither concave up or concave down, a graph has to be linear, so the graph of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> in the following figure is a straight line on <span class="process-math">\((-1,1)\text{.}\)</span> When a function is concave down, its graph looks like an upside down bowl. The function <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> in the figure is decreasing and concave down on the interval <span class="process-math">\((1,3)\text{.}\)</span> Note that <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is decreasing on the entire interval <span class="process-math">\((-3,3)\text{.}\)</span></p>
