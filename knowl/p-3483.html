<div class="para">From our sketch of the second derivative in (b), we can develop a second derivative sign chart for <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> In particular, we saw that <span class="process-math">\(f''(x) = 0\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x \approx -0.35\)</span> and at <span class="process-math">\(x = 1\text{,}\)</span> and that between these points, <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> is negative, while <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> is positive everywhere else. This shows that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is concave down for <span class="process-math">\(-0.35 \lt x \lt 1\)</span> while being concave up everywhere else. We thus see that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has points of inflection at both <span class="process-math">\(x \approx -0.35\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x = 1\text{.}\)</span>
