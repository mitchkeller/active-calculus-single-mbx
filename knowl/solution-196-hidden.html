<div class="para">SOLUTION</div> <div class="para">To determine which graphed function is the the derivative of another, we use the fact that the derivative is zero where the original function has a maximum or minimum.  We note that C has zeros where B has a maximum or minimum, so it could be the derivative, so we can have <span class="process-math">\(C = B'\text{.}\)</span> In addition, B has zeros where A has a maximum or minimum, so that it is possible that <span class="process-math">\(B = A'\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">To confirm this, we compare intervals where B is increasing and decreasing and verify that these are where C is positive and negative, respectively, and similarly compare A and B.</div> <div class="para">This gives us that <span class="process-math">\(f = A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f' = B\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f'' = C\text{.}\)</span>
