<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> be the length of one side of the square bottom and <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> the height of one of the sides. We first note that the volume, <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> of the box is <span class="process-math">\(V = x^2 h\text{,}\)</span> and the surface area of the box is <span class="process-math">\(S = 2x^2 +  4xh\text{,}\)</span> since there are two square sides (bottom and top) of area <span class="process-math">\(x^2\)</span> and four identical sides of area <span class="process-math">\(xh\text{.}\)</span> Since the material for the top and bottom costs $3.00 per square foot and the material for the sides costs $1.50 per square foot, it follows that the total cost of a box with surface area <span class="process-math">\(S\)</span> is</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
C = 1.50 (2x^2) +  3.00 (4xh) = 3x^2 + 12xh\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We are interested in building box of largest volume for which we spend $15. This cost constraint implies that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
15 = 3x^2 + 12xh\text{,}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which allows us to express <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> as a function of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> by solving for <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> Doing so, we see that <span class="process-math">\(12xh = 15 - 3x^2\text{,}\)</span> so</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
h = \frac{15-3x^2}{12x}\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Using this relationship, we are now able to express the volume, <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> of the box as a function of the single variable <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> Subsituting the expression for <span class="process-math">\(h\text{,}\)</span> we have</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
V = x^2 h = x^2 \frac{15-3x^2}{12x} = \frac{1}{12}x(15 - 3x^2) = \frac{15}{12}x - \frac{1}{4}x^3\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Note particularly that in order to have a box, we require that both <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(h \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> The latter condition along with the fact that <span class="process-math">\(h = \frac{15-3x^2}{12x}\)</span> shows that we need <span class="process-math">\(15 - 3x^2 \gt 0\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(x^2 \lt 5\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(x \lt \sqrt{5}\text{.}\)</span> Hence we are considering <span class="process-math">\(V(x)\)</span> on the domain <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt x \lt \sqrt{5}\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>It is apparent that the box vanishes (and its volume tends to zero) as either <span class="process-math">\(x \to 0^+\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x \to \sqrt{5}^-\text{,}\)</span> and thus the absolute maximum volume must appear between these values at a critical number. Differentiating <span class="process-math">\(V\text{,}\)</span> we find that <span class="process-math">\(V'(x) = \frac{15}{12} - \frac{3}{4}x^2\text{.}\)</span> Solving <span class="process-math">\(V'(x) = 0\)</span> to find all critical numbers of <span class="process-math">\(V\)</span> in the domain, we see that <span class="process-math">\(x^2 = \frac{15}{12} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = \frac{5}{3}\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(x = \pm \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\text{,}\)</span> so only <span class="process-math">\(x = \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\)</span> is a critical number that lies in <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt x \lt \sqrt{5}\text{.}\)</span> Noting that the absolute minimum volume <span class="process-math">\(V = 0\)</span> occurs at each endpoint, it must be the case that the absolute maximum volume is <span class="process-math">\(V\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right) = \frac{15}{12}\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right) - \frac{1}{4}\left( \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}} \right)^3 \approx 1.07583\)</span> cubic feet.</p>
