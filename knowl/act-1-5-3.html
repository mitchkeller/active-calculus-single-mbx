<p>Researchers at a major car company have found a function that relates gasoline consumption to speed for a particular model of car. In particular, they have determined that the consumption <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> in <em class="emphasis">liters per kilometer</em>, at a given speed <span class="process-math">\(s\text{,}\)</span> is given by a function <span class="process-math">\(C = f(s)\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is the car's speed in <em class="emphasis">kilometers per hour</em>.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Data provided by the car company tells us that <span class="process-math">\(f(80) = 0.015\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(f(90) = 0.02\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f(100) = 0.027\text{.}\)</span> Use this information to estimate the instantaneous rate of change of fuel consumption with respect to speed at <span class="process-math">\(s = 90\text{.}\)</span> Be as accurate as possible, use proper notation, and include units on your answer.</p></li>
<li><p>By writing a complete sentence, interpret the meaning (in the context of fuel consumption) of “<span class="process-math">\(f(80) = 0.015\text{.}\)</span>”</p></li>
<li><p>Write at least one complete sentence that interprets the meaning of the value of <span class="process-math">\(f'(90)\)</span> that you estimated in (a).</p></li>
