<div class="para">Moreover, this approach is consistent with the following goals:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">To have students engage in an active, inquiry-driven approach, where learners construct solutions and approaches to ideas, with appropriate support through questions posed, hints, and guidance from the instructor and text.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">To build in students intuition for why the main ideas in calculus are natural and true. Often we do this through consideration of the instantaneous position and velocity of a moving object.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">To challenge students to acquire deep, personal understanding of calculus through reading the text and completing preview activities on their own, working on activities in small groups in class, and doing substantial exercises outside of class time.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">To strengthen students' written and oral communicating skills by having them write about and explain aloud the key ideas of calculus.</div></li>
