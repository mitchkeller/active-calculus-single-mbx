<div class="para">In the previous question, we observed that <span class="process-math">\(75\)</span> degrees F is the critical temperature that changes the behavior of <span class="process-math">\(T\text{.}\)</span> There are several reasons to think that <span class="process-math">\(75\)</span> degrees F is room temperature: if the coffee's temperature is above room temperature (<span class="process-math">\(75\)</span>), its temperature will decrease to room temperature, while if the coffee is below room temperature, its temperature will increase to room temperature. Moreover, if the coffee's temperature is <span class="process-math">\(75\)</span> (which would match the room temperature), then its rate of change is <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and the coffee's temperature doesn't change.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-7-1-diff-eq-intro.html#TmB" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
