<li><p>A separable differential equation is one that may be rewritten with all occurrences of the dependent variable multiplying the derivative and all occurrences of the independent variable on the other side of the equation.</p></li>
<li><p>We may find the solutions to certain separable differential equations by separating variables, integrating with respect to <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> and ultimately solving the resulting algebraic equation for <span class="process-math">\(y\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>This technique allows us to solve many important differential equations that arise in the world around us. For instance, questions of growth and decay and Newton's Law of Cooling give rise to separable differential equations. Later, we will learn in <a href="sec-7-6-logistic.html" class="internal" title="Section 7.6: Population Growth and the Logistic Equation">SectionÂ 7.6</a> that the important logistic differential equation is also separable.</p></li>
