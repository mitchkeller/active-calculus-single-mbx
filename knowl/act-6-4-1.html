<p>Consider the following situations in which a varying force accomplishes work.</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li><p>Suppose that a heavy rope hangs over the side of a cliff. The rope is 200 feet long and weighs 0.3 pounds per foot; initially the rope is fully extended. How much work is required to haul in the entire length of the rope? (Hint: set up a function <span class="process-math">\(F(h)\)</span> whose value is the weight of the rope remaining over the cliff after <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> feet have been hauled in.)</p></li>
<li><p>A leaky bucket is being hauled up from a 100 foot deep well. When lifted from the water, the bucket and water together weigh 40 pounds. As the bucket is being hauled upward at a constant rate, the bucket leaks water at a constant rate so that it is losing weight at a rate of 0.1 pounds per foot. What function <span class="process-math">\(B(h)\)</span> tells the weight of the bucket after the bucket has been lifted <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> feet? What is the total amount of work accomplished in lifting the bucket to the top of the well?</p></li>
<li><p>Now suppose that the bucket in (b) does not leak at a constant rate, but rather that its weight at a height <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> feet above the water is given by <span class="process-math">\(B(h) = 25 + 15e^{-0.05h}\text{.}\)</span> What is the total work required to lift the bucket 100 feet? What is the average force exerted on the bucket on the interval <span class="process-math">\(h = 0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(h = 100\text{?}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>From physics, <em class="emphasis">Hooke's Law</em>  for springs states that the amount of force required to hold a spring that is compressed (or extended) to a particular length is proportionate to the distance the spring is compressed (or extended) from its natural length. That is, the force to compress (or extend) a spring <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> units from its natural length is <span class="process-math">\(F(x) = kx\)</span> for some constant <span class="process-math">\(k\)</span> (which is called the <em class="emphasis">spring constant</em>.) For springs, we choose to measure the force in pounds and the distance the spring is compressed in feet. Suppose that a force of 5 pounds extends a particular spring 4 inches (1/3 foot) beyond its natural length.</p>
<ol class="lower-roman">
<li><p>Use the given fact that <span class="process-math">\(F(1/3) = 5\)</span> to find the spring constant <span class="process-math">\(k\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Find the work done to extend the spring from its natural length to 1 foot beyond its natural length.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the work required to extend the spring from 1 foot beyond its natural length to 1.5 feet beyond its natural length.</p></li>
