<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(h'\)</span> is negative to the left of <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and positive to the right of <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> the function <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is decreasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt 0\)</span> and increasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> can have at most <span class="process-math">\(2\)</span> real roots (solutions to <span class="process-math">\(h(x)=0\text{.}\)</span> As the graphs in the following figure show, it is possible that <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> has no real zeros, one real zero, or two real zeros.</div>

<li><div class="para">Given that <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is decreasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt 0\)</span> and increasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 0\text{,}\)</span> the function <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> has an absolute minimum value at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> So one root is to the left of this minimum and the other to the right. Thus, one root is negative and the other positive. See, for instance, the lowest of the three possibilities for <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> shown in the figure in (a).</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The slopes of the tangent lines to <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> will all be near <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> but less than <span class="process-math">\(3\text{,}\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> gets large. So the graph of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> will look very much like a line with slope <span class="process-math">\(3\)</span> for large values of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">We note that <span class="process-math">\(h'\)</span> is increasing everywhere, <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is concave up everywhere. Since the graph of <span class="process-math">\(h'\)</span> levels off for large values of <span class="process-math">\(|x|\text{,}\)</span> the concavity of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is small when <span class="process-math">\(|x|\)</span> is large. Also, the largest value of the slope of the tangent line to <span class="process-math">\(h'\)</span> occurs when <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{,}\)</span> so <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> has its largest second dervitive when <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> So <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is almost linear as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> decreases without bound, <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> has more bend as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(0\text{,}\)</span> has its greatest bend at <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{,}\)</span> then the second derivative of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases, ultimately having <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> become almost linear as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases without bound.</div></li>
