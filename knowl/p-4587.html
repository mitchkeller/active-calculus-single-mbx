<div class="para">You decide to use a left endpoint Riemann sum to estimate the total displacement.  So, you pick up a blue pen and draw rectangles whose height is determined by the velocity measurement at the left endpoint of each one-second interval.  By using the left endpoint Riemann sum as an approximation, you are assuming that the actual velocity is approximately constant on each one-second interval (or, equivalently, that the actual acceleration is approximately zero on each one-second interval), and that the velocity and acceleration have discontinuous jumps every second.  This assumption is probably incorrect because it is likely that the velocity and acceleration change continuously over time.  However, you decide to use this approximation anyway since it seems like a reasonable approximation to the actual velocity given the limited amount of data.</div>
