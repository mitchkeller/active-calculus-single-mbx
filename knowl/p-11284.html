<div class="para">While it is natural to wonder how integrating a Taylor series might change the values of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> for which the series converges, it turns out that integrating a Taylor series has almost no effect<a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-118-hidden.html" title="Footnote 8.5.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> on where the series converges (nor does differentiating such a series).  This fact is stated formally in a result called The Power Series Differentiation and Integration Theorem.  (A <dfn class="terminology">power series</dfn> is any series of the form <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} c_k (x-a)^k\text{;}\)</span> every Taylor series is a power series, and a famous result called Borel’s Theorem tells us that every power series is in fact that Taylor series of a related function.)</div>
