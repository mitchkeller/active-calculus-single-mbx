<p>Finally, if we want to determine the mass of an object of non-constant density, because <span class="process-math">\(M = D \cdot V\)</span> (mass equals density times volume, provided that density is constant), we can consider a small slice of an object on which the density is approximately constant, and a definite integral may be used to determine the exact mass of the object. For instance, if we have a thin rod whose cross sections have constant density, but whose density is distributed along the <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> axis according to the function <span class="process-math">\(y = \rho(x)\text{,}\)</span> it follows that for a small slice of the rod that is <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x\)</span> thick, <span class="process-math">\(M_{\text{slice} } = \rho(x) \Delta x\text{.}\)</span> In the limit as <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x \to 0\text{,}\)</span> we then find that the total mass is given by</p>
