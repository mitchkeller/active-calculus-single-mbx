<div class="para">In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-1-4-ffprime.html" title="Figure 1.4.1">Figure 1.4.1</a>, on the left we show a plot of <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = 4x - x^2\)</span> together with a selection of tangent lines at the points we’ve considered above. On the right, we show a plot of <span class="process-math">\(f'(x) = 4 - 2x\)</span> with emphasis on the heights of the derivative graph at the same selection of points. Notice the connection between colors in the left and right graphs: the green tangent line on the original graph is tied to the green point on the right graph in the following way: <em class="emphasis">the slope of the tangent line</em> at a point on the lefthand graph is the same as the <em class="emphasis">height</em> at the corresponding point on the righthand graph. That is, at each respective value of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> the slope of the tangent line to the original function is the same as the height of the derivative function. Do note, however, that the units on the vertical axes are different: in the left graph, the vertical units are simply the output units of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> On the righthand graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = f'(x)\text{,}\)</span> the units on the vertical axis are units of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> per unit of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
