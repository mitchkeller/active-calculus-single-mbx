<div class="para">We know from the definition of the definite integral that if we let <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> be large enough, we can make any of the approximations <span class="process-math">\(L_n\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(R_n\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M_n\)</span> as close as weâ€™d like (in theory) to the exact value of <span class="process-math">\(\int_a^b f(x) \, dx\text{.}\)</span> Thus, it may be natural to wonder why we ever use any rule other than <span class="process-math">\(L_n\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(R_n\)</span> (with a sufficiently large <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> value) to estimate a definite integral. One of the primary reasons is that as <span class="process-math">\(n \to \infty\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n} \to 0\text{,}\)</span> and thus in a Riemann sum calculation with a large <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> value, we end up multiplying by a number that is very close to zero. Doing so often generates roundoff error, because representing numbers close to zero accurately is a persistent challenge for computers.</div>
