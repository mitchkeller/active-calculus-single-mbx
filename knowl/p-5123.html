<li><div class="para">Because the derivative of a constant is zero, if <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> it follows that <span class="process-math">\(G(x) = F(x) + C\)</span> will also be an antiderivative of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> Moreover, any two antiderivatives of a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> differ precisely by a constant. Thus, any function with at least one antiderivative in fact has infinitely many, and the graphs of any two antiderivatives will differ only by a vertical translation.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Given a function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> the rule <span class="process-math">\(A(x) = \int_a^x f(t) \, dt\)</span> defines a new function <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> that measures the net-signed area bounded by <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> on the interval <span class="process-math">\([a,x]\text{.}\)</span> We call the function <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> the integral function corresponding to <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span>
