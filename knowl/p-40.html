<div class="para">The text is written so that, on average, one section corresponds to two hours of class meeting time.  A typical instructional sequence when starting a new section might look like the following:</div>
<ul class="disc">
<li><div class="para">Students complete a Preview Activity in advance of class.  Class begins with a short debrief among peers followed by all class discussion.  (5-10 minutes)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Brief lecture and discussion to build on the preview activity and set the stage for the next activity. (5-10 minutes) </div></li>
<li><div class="para">Students engage with peers to work on and discuss the first activity in the section. (15-20 minutes) </div></li>
<li><div class="para">Brief discussion and possibly lecture to reach closure on the preceding activity, followed by transition to new ideas.  (Varies, but 5-15 minutes)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Possibly begin next activity.</div></li>
</ul>
<div class="para">The next hour of class would be similar, but without the Preview Activity to complete prior to class: the principal focus of class will be completing 2 activities.  Then rinse and repeat.</div>
