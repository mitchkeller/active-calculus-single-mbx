<p>The general technique of integration by parts involves trading the problem of integrating the product of two functions for the problem of integrating the product of two related functions. That is, we convert the problem of evaluating <span class="process-math">\(\int u \, dv\)</span> to that of evaluating <span class="process-math">\(\int v \, du\text{.}\)</span> This clearly shapes our choice of <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(v\text{.}\)</span> In <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/Ex-5-4-IBP.html" title="Example 5.4.1">ExampleÂ 5.4.1</a>, the original integral to evaluate was <span class="process-math">\(\int x \cos(x) \,dx\text{,}\)</span> and through the substitution provided by integration by parts, we were instead able to evaluate <span class="process-math">\(\int \sin(x) \cdot 1 \, dx\text{.}\)</span> Note that the original function <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> was replaced by its derivative, while <span class="process-math">\(\cos(x)\)</span> was replaced by its antiderivative.</p>
