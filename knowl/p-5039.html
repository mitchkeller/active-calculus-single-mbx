<div class="para">In most of our applications of the derivative so far, we have been interested in the instantaneous rate at which one variable, say <span class="process-math">\(y\text{,}\)</span> changes with respect to another, say <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> leading us to compute and interpret <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dy}{dx}\text{.}\)</span> We next consider situations where several variable quantities are related, but where each quantity is implicitly a function of time, which will be represented by the variable <span class="process-math">\(t\text{.}\)</span> Through knowing how the quantities are related, we will be interested in determining how their respective rates of change with respect to time are related.</div>
