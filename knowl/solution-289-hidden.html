<span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is accumulating positive signed area wherever <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is positive, and thus <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is increasing on <span class="process-math">\((0,1.5)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((4,6)\text{;}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is accumulating negative signed area and therefore decreasing wherever <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is negative, which occurs on <span class="process-math">\((1.5,4)\text{.}\)</span>

<li><div class="para">Here we want to consider where <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is changing at an increasing rate (concave up) or changing at a decreasing rate (concave down). On <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((4,5)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is increasing, and we can also see that since <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is increasing, <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is increasing at an increasing rate. Similarly, on <span class="process-math">\((3,4)\)</span> (where <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is negative so <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is decreasing), since <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is increasing it follows that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is decreasing at an increasing rate. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is concave up on <span class="process-math">\((0,1)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((3,5)\text{.}\)</span> Analogous reasoning shows that <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is concave down on <span class="process-math">\((1,3)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((5,6)\text{.}\)</span>

<li><div class="para">Using the fact that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is piecewise linear and the definition of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> we find that <span class="process-math">\(A(0) = \int_1^0 g(t) \, dt = -\int_0^1 g(t) \, dt = -\frac{1}{2}\text{;}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(A(1) = \int_1^1 g(t) \, dt = 0\text{;}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(A(2) = \int_1^2 g(t) \, dt = 0\text{.}\)</span> Analogous reasoning shows that <span class="process-math">\(A(3) = -2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(A(4) = -3.5\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(A(5) = -2\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(A(6) = -0.5\text{.}\)</span>
