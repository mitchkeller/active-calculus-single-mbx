<span class="process-math">\(AV_{[1.5,2]} = \frac{s(2)-s(1.5)}{2-1.5} = -24\)</span> ft/sec. We note that this average velocity is negative, and in fact is the opposite of the average velocity of 24 ft/sec on the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,0.5]\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(AV_{[1.499,1.5]} = -15.984\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(AV_{[1.5, 1.501]} = -16.016\text{,}\)</span> it appears that the instantaneous velocity of the ball at <span class="process-math">\(t = 1.5\)</span> is approximately <span class="process-math">\(-16\)</span> ft/sec. Similar computations show that at <span class="process-math">\(t = 2\text{,}\)</span> it appears the instantaneous velocity is about <span class="process-math">\(-32\)</span> ft/sec. Note that <span class="process-math">\(-16&gt;-32\text{,}\)</span> so the instantaneous velocity at <span class="process-math">\(t = 1.5\)</span> is greater because it is “less negative.” Asking which number is “greater” is different from asking which number is “more negative.”</div></li>
<li><div class="para">When the ball is rising, its instantaneous velocity is positive, while when the ball is falling, its instantaneous velocity is negative.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Note that <span class="process-math">\((1,s(1))\)</span> is the vertex of the parabola given by <span class="process-math">\(s(t)\text{.}\)</span> At this point, the ball is neither rising nor falling. On intervals of the form <span class="process-math">\([a,1]\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(a \lt 1\text{,}\)</span> the average velocity of the ball is positive; on intervals of form <span class="process-math">\([1,b]\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(b &gt; 1\text{,}\)</span> the average velocity is positive. Hence we expect the instantaneous velocity of the ball at the moment <span class="process-math">\(t = 1\)</span> to be zero.</div></li>
