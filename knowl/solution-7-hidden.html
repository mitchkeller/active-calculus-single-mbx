<em class="alert">SOLUTION</em> a) Over the interval   <span class="process-math">\(d  = 50\)</span>   to   <span class="process-math">\(d = 125\text{,}\)</span>     <span class="process-math">\(\Delta T = 5.30 - 5.20 = 0.0999999999999996\)</span>   and   <span class="process-math">\(\Delta d = 125 - 50 = 75\)</span> . Thus   <span class="process-math">\(\Delta T / \Delta d = 0.0999999999999996/75\)</span> . b) Over the interval   <span class="process-math">\(d  = 125\)</span>   to   <span class="process-math">\(d = 250\text{,}\)</span>     <span class="process-math">\(\Delta T = 6.50 - 5.30 = 1.2\)</span>   and   <span class="process-math">\(\Delta d = 250 - 125 = 125\)</span> . Thus   <span class="process-math">\(\Delta T / \Delta d = 1.2/125\)</span> . c) Over the interval   <span class="process-math">\(d  = 75\)</span>   to   <span class="process-math">\(d = 125\text{,}\)</span>     <span class="process-math">\(\Delta T = 5.30 - 5.10 = 0.2\)</span>   and   <span class="process-math">\(\Delta d = 125 - 75 = 50\)</span> . Thus   <span class="process-math">\(\Delta T / \Delta d = 0.2/50\)</span> . d)  Only the statement <em class="emphasis">Over the interval from 75 meters to 125 meters, the temperature changes on average at a rate of 0.004 degrees Celsius per meter</em> is correct.  All others are incorrect: The statement, 0.004 is the slope of the graph of at <em class="emphasis">d</em> = 75, is incorrect since the average rate of change is the slope of the line segment connect the endpoints of the interval. The statement, The temperature changes by a total of 0.004 degrees Celsius when moving from a depth 75 meters to 125 meters, is incorrect since the average rate of change is a ratio of the change in temperature divided by the change in depth (not just the total change in temperature. The statement, On average the temperature is changing at a rate of 0.004 degrees Celsius per minute over the interval <span class="process-math">\(75 \leq d \leq 125\text{,}\)</span> is incorrect since the units must be degrees Celsius per meter (not minute). The statement, The temperature is changing at a rate of 0.004 degrees Celsius per minute when the depth is 75 meters, is incorrect since the average rate of change averages the rates of change at every point in the interval.  It is not the rate of the change at just the initial depth.</div></body>
