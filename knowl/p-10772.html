It seems that by moving to <span class="process-math">\(a = 2\text{,}\)</span> which is further away from the asymptote at <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\text{,}\)</span> we can get approximations of <span class="process-math">\(ln(x)\)</span> that are good all the way up to <span class="process-math">\(x = 4\text{.}\)</span>
