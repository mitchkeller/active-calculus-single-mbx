<li><div class="para">Just like we can find the average velocity of a moving body by computing change in position over change in time, we can compute the average rate of change of any function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> In particular, the <em class="emphasis">average rate of change</em> of a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> over an interval <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\)</span> is the quotient<div class="displaymath process-math">

<li><div class="para">If we assume the population of Grand Rapids is growing at a rate of approximately 4% per decade, we can model the population function with the formula<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
P(t) = 181843 (1.04)^{t/10}\text{.}

<li><div class="para">How fast do you think the population of Grand Rapids was changing on January 1, 1985?
