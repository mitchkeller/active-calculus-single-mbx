<div class="para">To have a positive equilibrium solution, we require that <span class="process-math">\(40-C \lt 0\text{,}\)</span> and therefore the farmer must bring at least <span class="process-math">\(41\)</span> cats to the farm. Even in that circumstance, whether the cats can keep the number of mice from growing without bound will depend on the initial number of mice present.</div>
