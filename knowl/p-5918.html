<div class="para">Integration by parts is well suited to integrating the product of basic functions, allowing us to trade a given integrand for a new one where one function in the product is replaced by its derivative, and the other is replaced by its antiderivative. The goal in this trade of <span class="process-math">\(\int u \, dv\)</span> for <span class="process-math">\(\int v \, du\)</span> is that the new integral be simpler to evaluate than the original one. Sometimes it is necessary to apply integration by parts more than once in order to evaluate a given integral.</div>
