<div class="para">From the given graph of <span class="process-math">\(g'(x)\text{,}\)</span> we observe that <span class="process-math">\(g'\)</span> is undefined at <span class="process-math">\(x = -2, 0, 2\text{.}\)</span> Since we have been given that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is a continuous function, we can conclude that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> must have sharp corners on its graph at these points. Moreover, that makes sense in light of our earlier observations that show <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> has constant slope on the intervals that connect at <span class="process-math">\(x = -2, 0, 2\)</span> and the graph jumps from having slope <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{,}\)</span> and then back, and so on.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-1-4-derivative-fxn.html#li-522" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
