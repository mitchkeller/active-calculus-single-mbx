But when the curve bounds a region that is not a familiar geometric shape, we cannot find its area exactly. Indeed, this is one of our biggest goals in <a href="C-4.html" class="internal" title="Chapter 4: The Definite Integral">Chapter 4</a>: to learn how to find the exact area bounded between a curve and the horizontal axis for as many different types of functions as possible.</div>
