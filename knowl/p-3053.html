<div class="para">We note that <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\)</span> is not in the domain of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> so we may naturally wonder what happens as <span class="process-math">\(x \to 0\text{.}\)</span> As <span class="process-math">\(x \to 0^+\text{,}\)</span> we observe that <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> <em class="emphasis">increases without bound</em>. That is, we can make the value of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as large as we like by taking <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> closer and closer (but not equal) to 0, while keeping <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> This is a good way to think about what infinity represents: a quantity is tending to infinity if there is no single number that the quantity is always less than.</div>
