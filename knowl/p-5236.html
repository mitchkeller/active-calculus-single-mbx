<div class="para">A baseball diamond is a square with sides <span class="process-math">\(90\)</span> feet long. Suppose a baseball player is advancing from second to third base at the rate of <span class="process-math">\(24\)</span> feet per second, and an umpire is standing on home plate. Let <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> be the angle between the third baseline and the line of sight from the umpire to the runner. How fast is <span class="process-math">\(\theta\)</span> changing when the runner is <span class="process-math">\(30\)</span> feet from third base?</div>
