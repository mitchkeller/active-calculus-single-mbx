That is, the difference between 3.5 and 4, and between 3.75 and 4.  Thus, taking the magnitude of the differences, Error in Euler with two steps = 0.5, and Error in Euler with four steps = 0.25. <em class="alert">D.</em> Since we doubled the number of steps we took, we expect the error to drop by a factor of two (that is, the error in the Euler approximation with two steps should be twice as big as that with four), which it is.</div>
