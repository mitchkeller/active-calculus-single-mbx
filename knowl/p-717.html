<div class="para">We now know that the instantaneous rate of change of a function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> or equivalently the slope of the tangent line to the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = f(x)\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x = a\text{,}\)</span> is given by the value <span class="process-math">\(f'(a)\text{.}\)</span> In all of our examples so far, we have identified a particular value of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> as our point of interest: <span class="process-math">\(a = 1\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(a = 3\text{,}\)</span> etc. But it is not hard to imagine that we will often be interested in the derivative value for more than just one <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span>-value, and possibly for many of them. In this section, we explore how we can move from computing the derivative at a single point to computing a formula for <span class="process-math">\(f'(a)\)</span> at any point <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> Indeed, the process of “taking the derivative” generates a new function, denoted by <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\text{,}\)</span> derived from the original function <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\text{.}\)</span>
