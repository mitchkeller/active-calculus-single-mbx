<div class="para">For a given function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and interval <span class="process-math">\([a,b]\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(E_{T,4} = T_4 - \int_a^b f(x) \,dx\)</span> calculates the difference between the approximation generated by the Trapezoid Rule with <span class="process-math">\(n = 4\)</span> and the exact value of the definite integral. If we look at not only <span class="process-math">\(E_{T,4}\text{,}\)</span> but also the other errors generated by using <span class="process-math">\(T_n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M_n\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(n = 4\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(n = 8\)</span> in the two examples noted in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/T-5-6-Ex2.html" title="Table 5.6.5: Calculations of T_4 M_4 T_8 and M_8 along with corresponding errors, for the definite integrals \int_0^1 (1-x^2) \  dx and \int_1^2 \frac{1}{x^2} \  dx">TableÂ 5.6.5</a>, we see an evident pattern. Not only is the sign of the error (which measures whether the rule generates an over- or under-estimate) tied to the rule used and the function's concavity, but the magnitude of the errors generated by <span class="process-math">\(T_n\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(M_n\)</span> seems closely connected. In particular, the errors generated by the Midpoint Rule seem to be about half the size (in absolute value) of those generated by the Trapezoid Rule.</div>
