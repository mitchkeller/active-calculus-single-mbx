<body class="ignore-math"><div class="solution solution-like">
<em class="alert">(a)</em> A graph of <span class="process-math">\(dP/dt\)</span> vs <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is shown below. <div class="image-box" style="width: 41%; margin-left: 29.5%; margin-right: 29.5%;"><img src="generated/webwork/images/webwork-353-image-1.png" class="contained"></div> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(dP/dt\)</span> is negative when <span class="process-math">\(0 \lt  P \lt  b/a\)</span> and positive when <span class="process-math">\(b/a \lt  P \lt  \infty\)</span> (we ignore <span class="process-math">\(P \lt  0\text{,}\)</span> because this doesnâ€™t make sense for a population). <em class="alert">(b)</em> We can see from the graph above that <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is a decreasing function when <span class="process-math">\(P\lt \frac{b}{a}\text{.}\)</span>  Similarly, when <span class="process-math">\(P&gt;\frac{b}{a}\text{,}\)</span> the sign of <span class="process-math">\(dP/dt\)</span> is positive, so <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> is an increasing function.  Thus solution curves starting above <span class="process-math">\(\frac{b}{a}\)</span> are increasing, and those starting below <span class="process-math">\(\frac{b}{a}\)</span> are decreasing. We can also see that for <span class="process-math">\(P&gt;\frac{b}{a}\text{,}\)</span> the slope, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dP}{dt}\text{,}\)</span> increases with <span class="process-math">\(P\text{,}\)</span> so the graph of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> against <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> is concave up. For <span class="process-math">\(0\lt P\lt \frac{b}{a}\text{,}\)</span> the value of <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> decreases with time.  As <span class="process-math">\(P\)</span> decreases, the slope <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dP}{dt}\)</span> decreases for <span class="process-math">\(\frac{b}{2a}\lt P\lt \frac{b}{a}\text{,}\)</span> and increases toward 0 for <span class="process-math">\(0\lt P\lt \frac{b}{2a}\text{.}\)</span>  Thus solution curves starting just below the threshold value of <span class="process-math">\(\frac{b}{a}\)</span> are concave down for <span class="process-math">\(\frac{b}{2a}\lt P\lt \frac{b}{a}\)</span> and concave up and asymptotic to the <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis for <span class="process-math">\(0\lt P\lt \frac{b}{2a}\text{.}\)</span>  Thus, solution curves are similar to those shown in the graph below <div class="image-box" style="width: 41%; margin-left: 29.5%; margin-right: 29.5%;"><img src="generated/webwork/images/webwork-353-image-2.png" class="contained"></div> <span class="process-math">\(P=\frac{b}{a}\)</span> is called the threshold population because for populations greater than <span class="process-math">\(\frac{b}{a}\text{,}\)</span> the population will increase without bound. For populations less than <span class="process-math">\(\frac{b}{a}\text{,}\)</span> the population will go to zero, i.e. to extinction.  The value <span class="process-math">\(\frac{b}{a}\)</span> is an unstable equilibrium, and <span class="process-math">\(P=0\)</span> is a stable equilibrium.</div></body>
