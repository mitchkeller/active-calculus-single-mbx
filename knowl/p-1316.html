<div class="para">To find the average rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> on the interval <span class="process-math">\([40000,55000]\text{,}\)</span> we divide the change in <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> values (in dollars) on this interval by the change in <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> values (in miles) to obtain</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
AV_{[40000,55000]} = \frac{h(55000)- h(40000)}{55000-40000} = \frac{13200-15500}{15000} = -\frac{2300}{15000} \approx -0.153

<div class="para">dollars per mile. This tells us that from the mileage of <span class="process-math">\(40 000\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(50 000\)</span> miles, on average the car’s value decreases by <span class="process-math">\(0.153\)</span> dollars per mile driven.</div>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para logical">
<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(40 000\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(70 0000\)</span> are equidistant from <span class="process-math">\(55 000\text{,}\)</span> we use the central difference quotient to approximate the derivative of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(55 0000\)</span> to obtain</div>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
h'(55000) \approx \frac{h(70000) - h(40000)}{70000-40000} = \frac{11100-15500}{30000} = - \frac{4400}{30000} \approx -0.147
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="para">dollars per mile. This approximation tells us that at the instant the car has been driven <span class="process-math">\(55 000\)</span> miles, the car’s value is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of <span class="process-math">\(0.147\)</span> dollars per mile. That is, during <span class="process-math">\(55 0001\)</span>st mile, we’d expect the car’s value to drop by <span class="process-math">\(0.147\)</span> dollars.</div>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">As we pile up miles on our car, we expect the value to go down. However, we should expect the depreciation to be more extreme at first, but less in magnitude as we drive more miles and our car gets older. Note, though, the the value of the car is always decreasing and <span class="process-math">\(h'(m)\)</span> is always negative. Thus, we should expect that the rate of change of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is increasing (becoming less negative) as <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> increases and that <span class="process-math">\(h'(30000) \lt h'(80000)\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The value of a car is never negative. So we know that <span class="process-math">\(h(m) \geq 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(m\text{.}\)</span> A new car decreases in value very quickly at first, and as the car gets older with more mileage, its value will depreciate to near zero. So <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is a decreasing function. Since the value of our car always decreases, it follows that <span class="process-math">\(h'(m) \lt 0\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(m \gt 0\text{.}\)</span> The fact that the depreciation slows as <span class="process-math">\(m\)</span> increases implies that <span class="process-math">\(h'\)</span> is an increasing (getting less negative) function. Since <span class="process-math">\(h'\)</span> is increasing, it follows that <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> is bends upward; we will study this issue more in Section 1.6. So the graph of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span> might have the general shape of the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = e^{-x}\)</span> for positive values of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
