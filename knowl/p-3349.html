<div class="para">To produce the first derivative sign chart in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-3-1-signchart.html" title="Figure 3.1.8">Figure 3.1.8</a> we identify the sign of each factor of <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> at one selected point in each interval. For instance, for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt -1\text{,}\)</span> we could determine the sign of <span class="process-math">\(e^{-2x}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\((3-x)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((x+1)^2\)</span> at the value <span class="process-math">\(x = -2\text{.}\)</span> We note that both <span class="process-math">\(e^{-2x}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\((x+1)^2\)</span> are positive regardless of the value of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> while <span class="process-math">\((3-x)\)</span> is also positive at <span class="process-math">\(x = -2\text{.}\)</span> Hence, each of the three terms in <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is positive, which we indicate by writing “<span class="process-math">\(+++\text{.}\)</span>” Taking the product of three positive terms results in a positive value for <span class="process-math">\(f'\text{,}\)</span> which we denote by the “<span class="process-math">\(+\)</span>” in the interval to the left of <span class="process-math">\(x = -1\text{.}\)</span> And, since <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is positive on that interval, we know that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is increasing, so we write “INC” to represent the behavior of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> In a similar way, we find that <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is positive and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is increasing on <span class="process-math">\(-1 \lt x \lt 3\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is negative and <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is decreasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 3\text{.}\)</span>
