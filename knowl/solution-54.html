<p>Using the central difference formula, we find that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
F'(10) \approx \frac{F(10.01) - F(9.99)}{0.02} = \frac{(75 + 110 e^{-0.05\cdot 10.01}) - (75 + 110 e^{-0.05\cdot 9.99})}{0.02} \approx -3.33592\text{.}
\end{equation*}
</div>
</li>
<li><p>Since <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is measured in degrees Fahrenheit and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in minutes, we have <span class="process-math">\(F'(10) \approx -3.33592\)</span> degrees F per minute. This means that at the instant <span class="process-math">\(t=10\text{,}\)</span> the temperature of the coffee is decreasing at an instantaneous rate of about <span class="process-math">\(3.33592\)</span> degrees per minute. Said differently, in the next minute, we'd expect the temperature of the coffee to drop about <span class="process-math">\(3.33592\)</span> degrees.</p></li>
<li><p>We expect the coffee's temperature to decrease quickly early on when the difference between its temperature and the surroundings is greatest, and as time goes on for the coffee's temperature to approach that of the surrounding room. Keeping in mind that <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is an always decreasing function so that <span class="process-math">\(F'\)</span> is always negative, we observe that <span class="process-math">\(F'(10)\)</span> should be less (more negative) than <span class="process-math">\(F'(20)\text{.}\)</span> These observations can also be confirmed by plotting a graph of <span class="process-math">\(F\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We have noted that <span class="process-math">\(F'\)</span> is always negative, and that we expect <span class="process-math">\(F'\)</span> to get closer and closer to <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> as time goes on (that is, <span class="process-math">\(F'\)</span> is increasing). As such, we expect <span class="process-math">\(F'\)</span> to look something like the graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = -e^{-x}\text{.}\)</span> This is reasonable since <span class="process-math">\(-e^{-x}\)</span> is also an exponential function, is always negative, is always increasing, and approaches <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> increases.</p></li>
