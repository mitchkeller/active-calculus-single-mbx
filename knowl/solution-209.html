\begin{equation*}
E'(x) = e^{-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}} \cdot \frac{d}{dx}\left[ -\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2} \right] = e^{-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}} \cdot \left[ -\frac{2(x-m)}{2s^2} \right]

<p class="continuation">Note that <span class="process-math">\(E'(x)\)</span> is defined for every value of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> thus the only critical numbers occur where <span class="process-math">\(E'(x) = 0\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> raised to any power is never zero, the only way that <span class="process-math">\(E'(x) = 0\)</span> is for <span class="process-math">\(\left[ -\frac{2(x-m)}{2s^2} \right] = 0\text{,}\)</span> which implies that <span class="process-math">\(x = m\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(x = m\)</span> is the only critical number of <span class="process-math">\(E\text{.}\)</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>As we noted in (a), <span class="process-math">\(x = m\)</span> is the only critical number of <span class="process-math">\(E\text{.}\)</span> More over, since <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> to any power is always positive, the sign of <span class="process-math">\(E'(x)\)</span> depends entirely on the expression <span class="process-math">\(-\frac{2(x-m)}{2s^2} = -\frac{1}{2}(x-m)\text{.}\)</span> This linear function of <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> has negative slope, and thus is positive for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt m\)</span> and negative for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt m\text{,}\)</span> and thus <span class="process-math">\(E'(x)\)</span> is positive for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt m\)</span> and negative for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt m\text{.}\)</span> Therefore, <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> is increasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt m\)</span> and decreasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt m\text{,}\)</span> with a local maximum at <span class="process-math">\(x = m\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>From the given formula for <span class="process-math">\(E''(x)\)</span> and our knowledge that <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> to any power is positive, the only way <span class="process-math">\(E''(x) = 0\)</span> is for</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="">
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac{(x-m)^2 - s^2}{s^4} \right) = 0\text{,}

<p class="continuation">which implies that <span class="process-math">\((x-m)^2 = s^2\text{,}\)</span> and therefore <span class="process-math">\(x-m = \pm s\text{,}\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x = m \pm s\text{.}\)</span> These are the two values for which <span class="process-math">\(E''(x) = 0\text{.}\)</span></p>
</li>
<li><p>As <span class="process-math">\(x \to \pm \infty\text{,}\)</span> we know that the quadratic function <span class="process-math">\(-\frac{(x-m)^2}{2s^2}\)</span> must decrease without bound because the quadratic function opens down. Thus, the power to which we are raising <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> in the formula for <span class="process-math">\(E(x)\)</span> is decreasing without bound, which means that <span class="process-math">\(E(x)\)</span> must approach <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> since raising <span class="process-math">\(e\)</span> to more and more negative numbers drives the result to <span class="process-math">\(0\text{.}\)</span> Thus, <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to \infty} E(x) = \lim_{x \to -\infty} E(x) = 0\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>We've shown that <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> has a single critical number at <span class="process-math">\(x = m\)</span> and two potential points of inflection at <span class="process-math">\(x = m \pm s\text{,}\)</span> as well as that <span class="process-math">\(E(x) \to 0\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x \to \pm \infty\text{.}\)</span> All of these properties are reflected in the following figure.</p>
