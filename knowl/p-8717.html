<div class="para">If we slice the baseball bat perpendicular to the horizontal axes, we get thin cylindrical disks as cross-sections. At a given <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-location, the amount of weight concentrated there is approximately the weight density (<span class="process-math">\(0.6\)</span> ounces per cubic inch) times the volume of the slice, which is <span class="process-math">\(V_{text{slice}} \approx \pi f(x)^2\text{.}\)</span> Thus, we see that the amount of weight concentrated at a location <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> along the bat is given by <span class="process-math">\(\rho(x) = 0.6 \pi f(x)^2\text{,}\)</span> which we can therefore view as being the weight density function for how the weight of the baseball bat is distributed from <span class="process-math">\(x = 0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(x = 30\text{.}\)</span>
