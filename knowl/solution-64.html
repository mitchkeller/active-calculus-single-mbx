<li><div class="para">Observe that <span class="process-math">\(v(t) = 16-32t\)</span> is a linear function with negative slope <span class="process-math">\(-32\text{,}\)</span> and thus decreasing. Since the function is of interest from <span class="process-math">\(t = 0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(t=2\text{,}\)</span> the velocity is greatest at the left endpoint, when <span class="process-math">\(t=0\text{.}\)</span> This greatest velocity is <span class="process-math">\(v(0) = 16\)</span> feet per second.</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is a linear function, its slope is constant, and hence the slope of every tangent line to the function is the same as the slope of the line the function generates. Thus, <span class="process-math">\(v'(1) = -32\text{.}\)</span>
</div></li>
<li><div class="para">Because <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is measured in feet per second and <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> in seconds, the units on <span class="process-math">\(v'(1)\)</span> are ``feet per second per second.’’ Knowing that <span class="process-math">\(v'(1) = -32\text{,}\)</span> this tells us that the ball’s velocity is decreasing at a rate of 32 feet per second per second; that is, for whatever the ball’s velocity is at <span class="process-math">\(t = 1\text{,}\)</span> we would expect the velocity to decrease by (exactly) <span class="process-math">\(32\)</span> feet per second over the next one second. (Normally this total decrease would be approximate, not exact, but since the velocity function is linear, we can compute the exact total change.)</div></li>
<li><div class="para">The instantaneous rate of change of velocity is precisely the acceleration of the ball. Indeed, <span class="process-math">\(v'(t)\)</span> tells us how the ball’s velocity changes, and that it does so at a constant rate of <span class="process-math">\(-32\)</span> feet per second per second. This is also consistent with the fact that acceleration due to gravity is constant.</div></li>
