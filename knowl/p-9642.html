<p>Since <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = e^x\)</span> is not linear, the linear approximation eventually is not a very good one. To obtain better approximations, we want to develop a different approximation that “bends” to make it more closely fit the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> near <span class="process-math">\(x=0\text{.}\)</span> To do so, we  add a quadratic term to <span class="process-math">\(P_1(x)\text{.}\)</span> In other words, we let</p>

<p>Remember that <span class="process-math">\(P_1(x)\)</span> was a good linear approximation to <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> near <span class="process-math">\(0\text{;}\)</span> this is because <span class="process-math">\(P_1(0) = f(0)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P'_1(0) = f'(0)\text{.}\)</span> It is therefore reasonable to seek a value of <span class="process-math">\(c_2\)</span> so that</p>
