<div class="para">If we were to compute the partial sums <span class="process-math">\(S_n\)</span> of any alternating series whose terms decrease to zero and plot the points <span class="process-math">\((n,S_n)\)</span> as we did in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/F-8a-5-ExGeom.html" title="Figure 8.5.6">FigureÂ 8.5.6</a>, we would see a similar picture:  the partial sums alternate above and below the value to which the infinite alternating series converges.  In addition, because the terms go to zero, the amount a given partial sum deviates from the total sum is at most the next term in the series.  This result is formally stated as the Alternating Series Estimation Theorem.</div>
