<li><p>From the given graph of <span class="process-math">\(f'\text{,}\)</span> the first derivative sign chart for <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> shows that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has critical numbers at <span class="process-math">\(x = -1, 1\)</span> and that <span class="process-math">\(f'\)</span> is positive for <span class="process-math">\(-1 \lt x \lt 1\)</span> and for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 1\text{,}\)</span> while being negative for all <span class="process-math">\(x \lt -1\text{.}\)</span> Hence <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is increasing for <span class="process-math">\(-1 \lt x \lt 1\)</span> and for <span class="process-math">\(x \gt 1\text{,}\)</span> and decreasing for <span class="process-math">\(x \lt -1\text{.}\)</span> It follows by the first derivative test that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a local minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x = -1\)</span> because <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> changes from decreasing to increasing there.</p></li>
<li><p>Based on where <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> has horizontal tangent lines and where its slope is positive and negative, we can sketch an approximate graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = f''(x)\)</span> in the usual way that we sketch the derivative of a given function. From the given graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = f'(x)\text{,}\)</span> we can see that <span class="process-math">\(f''(x) = 0\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x \approx -0.35\)</span> and at <span class="process-math">\(x = 1\text{,}\)</span> and that between these points, <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> is negative because <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> is decreasing, while <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> is positive everywhere else since <span class="process-math">\(f'(x)\)</span> is increasing everywhere else. A possible graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = f''(x)\)</span> is shown at right in the following figure.</p></li>
<li><p>From our sketch of the second derivative in (b), we can develop a second derivative sign chart for <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span> In particular, we saw that <span class="process-math">\(f''(x) = 0\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x \approx -0.35\)</span> and at <span class="process-math">\(x = 1\text{,}\)</span> and that between these points, <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> is negative, while <span class="process-math">\(f''(x)\)</span> is positive everywhere else. This shows that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is concave down for <span class="process-math">\(-0.35 \lt x \lt 1\)</span> while being concave up everywhere else. We thus see that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has points of inflection at both <span class="process-math">\(x \approx -0.35\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(x = 1\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li>
<p>Now that we know where <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is increasing and decreasing as well as where <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is concave up and concave down, along with the fact that <span class="process-math">\(f(0) = -0.5\text{,}\)</span> we can sketch an approximate graph of <span class="process-math">\(y = f(x)\text{.}\)</span> Note that we also know <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a horizontal tangent line at <span class="process-math">\(x = 1\)</span> while being increasing on either side of <span class="process-math">\(x = 1\text{,}\)</span> and earlier we established that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a local minimum at <span class="process-math">\(x = -1\text{.}\)</span> After making a few rough sketches and shifting the graph vertically to pass through <span class="process-math">\((0,-0.5)\text{,}\)</span> we arrive at the graph shown at left below.</p>
