<li><p>Limits enable us to examine trends in function behavior near a specific point. In particular, taking a limit at a given point asks if the function values nearby tend to approach a particular fixed value.</p></li>
<li><p>We read <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L\text{,}\)</span> as “the limit of <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> approaches <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(L\text{,}\)</span>” which means that we can make the value of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as close to <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> as we want by taking <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> sufficiently close (but not equal) to <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>To find <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to a} f(x)\)</span> for a given value of <span class="process-math">\(a\)</span> and a known function <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> we can estimate this value from the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> or we can make a table of function values for <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span>-values that are closer and closer to <span class="process-math">\(a\text{.}\)</span> If we want the exact value of the limit, we can work with the function algebraically to understand how different parts of the formula for <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> change as <span class="process-math">\(x \to a\text{.}\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>We find the instantaneous velocity of a moving object at a fixed time by taking the limit of average velocities of the object over shorter and shorter time intervals containing the time of interest.</p></li>
