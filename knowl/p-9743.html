<div class="para">So far, we have focused our attention on a collection of five basic functions functions — <span class="process-math">\(\frac{1}{1-x}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\ln(1+x)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\sin(x)\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\cos(x)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(e^x\)</span> — and their Taylor series centered at <span class="process-math">\(a = 0\text{.}\)</span>  One of the reasons we were able to find these Taylor series is the patterns that arise in the derivatives of each of these functions.  While we can always use <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/D-8a-4-Taylor-series.html" title="Definition 8.4.1">Definition 8.4.1</a> to find the first few terms of the Taylor series, for most functions it is challenging to find a pattern among the various derivatives that allows us to state the general <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span>th term of the series.</div>
