<p>We recalling that a function <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has a limit <span class="process-math">\(L\)</span> at infinity if we can make the values of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)\)</span> as large as we want by choosing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> as large as we need. Since we can make the values of <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> in our sequence as large as we want by choosing <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> to be as large as we need, we suspect that this sequence does not have a limit as <span class="process-math">\(n\)</span> goes to infinity.</p>
