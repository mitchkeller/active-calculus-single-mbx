<div class="para">Observe that <span class="process-math">\(s(2) - s(0) = (32 - 32) - (0 - 0) = 0\text{.}\)</span> This means that the ball has zero change in position on the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,2]\text{.}\)</span> But we already established that on the interval <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\text{,}\)</span> the ball traveled 16 feet vertically; since the velocity becomes negative on the interval <span class="process-math">\(1 \lt t \lt 2\text{,}\)</span> there we know the ball's position is decreasing, so it is falling back to earth. The resulting zero change in position means that at <span class="process-math">\(t = 2\)</span> the ball has returned to the location from which it was tossed. If we view the area between the velocity function and the <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span>-axis as being negative wherever <span class="process-math">\(v\)</span> is negative, then we see that the areas of the two triangles involved are opposites, which in some sense results in the “total area” being zero, matching the change in position.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="sec-4-1-velocity-distance.html#li-2574" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
