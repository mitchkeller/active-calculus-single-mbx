<div class="para">The total number of people infected with a virus often grows like a logistic curve.  Suppose that 25 people originally have the virus, and that in the early stages of the virus (with time, <span class="process-math">\(t\text{,}\)</span> measured in weeks), the number of people infected is increasing exponentially with <span class="process-math">\(k=1.9\text{.}\)</span>  It is estimated that, in the long run, approximately 6000 people become infected.</div>
