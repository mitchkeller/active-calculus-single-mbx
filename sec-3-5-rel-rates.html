<p id="pdA">For example, suppose that air is being pumped into a spherical balloon so that its volume increases at a constant rate of 20 cubic inches per second. Since the balloon's volume and radius are related, by knowing how fast the volume is changing, we ought to be able to discover how fast the radius is changing. We are interested in questions such as: can we determine how fast the radius of the balloon is increasing at the moment the balloon's diameter is 12 inches?</p>

<p id="Hhe">As sand falls from the conveyor belt, several features of the sand pile will change: the volume of the pile will grow, the height will increase, and the radius will get bigger, too. All of these quantities are related to one another, and the rate at which each is changing is related to the rate at which sand falls from the conveyor.</p>
<p id="non">We begin by identifying which variables are changing and how they are related. In this problem, we observe that the radius and height of the pile are related to its volume by the standard equation for the volume of a cone,</p>

</ol></article><p id="yxm">In addition to finding instantaneous rates of change at particular points in time, we can often make more general observations about how particular rates themselves will change over time. For instance, when a conical tank is filling with water at a constant rate, it seems obvious that the depth of the water should increase more slowly over time. Note how carefully we must phrase the relationship: we mean to say that while the depth, <span class="process-math">\(h\text{,}\)</span> of the water is increasing, its rate of change, <span class="process-math">\(\frac{dh}{dt}\text{,}\)</span> is decreasing (both as a function of <span class="process-math">\(t\)</span> and as a function of <span class="process-math">\(h\)</span>). We make this observation by solving the equation that relates the various rates for one particular rate, without substituting any particular values for known variables or rates. For instance, in the conical tank problem in <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/act-3-5-1.html" title="Activity 3.5.2">Activity 3.5.2</a>, we established that</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math" data-contains-math-knowls="./knowl/act-3-5-1.html">
