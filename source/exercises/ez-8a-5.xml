    <statement>
      <p>
        In this exercise we find the Taylor series representation for two famous functions, the Fresnel integral functions
        <me>
          C(x) = \int_0^x \cos(t^2) \, dt
        </me>
        and
        <me>
          S(x) = \int_0^x \sin(t^2) \, dt
        </me>.
        The Fresnel integral functions are important in optics and are used in the design of Fresnel lenses such as those found in lighthouses along the Lake Michigan shore.

    <statement>
      <p>
          The fact that we can differentiate or integrate a Taylor series reveals other important ways we can think about functions such as <m>e^x</m>.

              Perhaps the most important property of the function <m>h(x) = e^x</m> is that <m>h'(x) = e^x</m>; that is, the function <m>e^x</m> is its own derivative.  Suppose that we didn't yet know the coefficients of the Taylor series expansion for <m>e^x</m>, so we just said
              <men xml:id="ez-8a-5-2-exp">
